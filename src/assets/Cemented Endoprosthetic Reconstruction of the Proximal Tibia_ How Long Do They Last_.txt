Abstract
Background The few available studies documenting the
long-term survival of cemented proximal tibial endopros-
theses for musculoskeletal
tumors do not differentiate
between stem designs or patient diagnosis. There is wide
variation in survival rates reported, possibly a result of this
heterogeneity in patient population and implant design.
Questions/purposes We therefore asked: (1) How long do
proximal tibial endoprostheses last? (2) What is the typical
long-term functional result after proximal tibial replace-
ment? And (3) what are the short- and long-term

complications associated with endoprosthetic reconstruc-
tion of the proximal tibia, particularly with respect to the
soft tissue reconstruction?
Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 52
patients with 52 proximal
tibial endoprosthetic recon-
structions for a tumor-related diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier
survivorship analysis was performed using revision of the
stemmed components for any reason as an endpoint for
implants, and death due to disease progression for patients.
Function was assessed using the MSTS scoring system.
The minimum followup was 1 month (mean, 96 months:
range, 1–284 months; median, 69 months).
Results Using revision of the stemmed components for
any reason as an end point, overall prosthesis survival at 5,
10, 15, and 20 years was 94%, 86%, 66%, and 37%,
respectively. The 29 modular implants demonstrated a
trend toward improved survival compared to the 23 cus-
tom-designed components, with a 15-year survivorship of
88% versus 63%. The mean postoperative Musculoskeletal
Tumor Society score at most recent followup was 82% of
normal function (mean raw score, 24.6; range, 4–29).
Conclusions Cemented endoprosthetic reconstruction of
the proximal tibia provides a reliable method of recon-
struction following tumor resection.

Introduction

Amputation was the standard method for achieving local
control of tumors of the proximal tibia prior to the early
1970s. Since the advent of effective chemotherapeutic reg-
imens,
limb sparing surgery provides improved patient

function and acceptance when compared to amputation [41,
43, 46]. The ﬁrst limb salvage efforts in this anatomic
location consisted largely of resection arthroplasty [2, 5, 17,
29]. Alternative methods of reconstruction for tumors
involving this anatomic location include Van Ness rota-
tionplasty [17, 22, 29], resection arthrodesis [2, 5], allograft
[4, 6, 15, 53], allograft-prosthetic composite reconstruction
[7, 21, 25], and endoprosthetic reconstruction. Acceptable
long-term implant survival may be obtained with allograft-
prosthetic composite techniques [7, 21, 25], which provide a
substrate for soft tissue and extensor mechanism attachment.
Allograft-prosthetic composites offer the best alternative to
endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal tibia as bio-
logic ﬁxation can be achieved through direct attachment of
the patellar tendon to the allograft bone [7, 21, 25].

Early attempts at endoprosthetic proximal tibial recon-
struction were fraught with wound-related complications,
patellar tendon attachment problems, and high rates of
repeat surgery, largely a result of an insufﬁcient soft tissue
envelope to surround the proximal tibia [20]. In 1983, at
the second International Symposium on Limb Salvage
(ISOLS) meeting in Vienna, Austria, Jean Dubousset of
France ﬁrst reported his results using a medial gastrocne-
mius rotation ﬂap as a means of obtaining soft tissue
coverage over a proximal tibial endoprosthesis [8]. The
clinical success of this technique in terms of extensor
mechanism function and soft tissue healing permitted the
routine use of endoprostheses for
reconstruction after
tumor resection of the proximal tibia [9, 10, 38].

Cemented proximal tibial endoprostheses are widely used
today [3, 14, 16, 19, 23, 26, 33, 36, 37, 51]. A few reports
available document the long-term survival of these devices
for musculoskeletal tumors [26, 36, 51]. These studies
document a wide range of implant survival from 22% to 86%
[3, 14, 18, 19, 23, 26, 33, 36, 37, 44, 51]. Additionally, these
studies make no attempt to account for changes in implant
design or differences among patient diagnoses.

We therefore sought to address the following questions:
(1) How long do proximal tibial endoprostheses last? (2)
What is the typical long-term functional result following
proximal tibial replacement? And (3) what are the short-
and long-term complications associated with endopros-
thetic reconstruction of the proximal tibia, particularly with
respect to the soft tissue reconstruction?

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all 57 patients
who underwent cemented endoprosthetic tibial reconstruc-
tion between December 1985 and December 2008. Three
skeletally immature patients underwent reconstruction with
an expandable prosthesis, with the intent of performing

multiple expansions and component exchanges during
growth and were not included in the present analysis. An
additional two reconstructions were performed for a diag-
nosis other than musculoskeletal
tumor and were also
excluded from the study cohort. This left 52 proximal tibial
endoprosthetic reconstructions in 52 patients with a tumor-
related diagnosis available for study (Table 1). The study
cohort of 52 reconstructions was divided into two groups,
according to the staging system described by Enneking et al.
[12]: Group 1 (n = 9) included those with low-grade
malignancy (Stage IA or IB) or benign conditions, and
Group 2 (n = 43) consisted of those with high-grade local-
ized disease (Stage IIA or IIB). There were no patients with
Stage III primary sarcomas or metastatic disease in this
cohort. Minimum followup for all patients was 1 month
(mean, 96.0 months; range, 1.0–283.6 months; median, 69.2
months). At the time of most recent followup, 13 of 52
patients (25%) had died, 11 due to progression of disease,
one due to sepsis related to a perirectal abscess, and another
due to age-related causes. Thirty-nine patients (75%)
remained alive; 38 patients were disease-free, and one
patient with giant cell tumor and stable pulmonary nodules
was alive at 148.4 months. No patients were seen speciﬁ-
cally for this chart review. Eleven of the 52 patients were
followed for less than 2 years. Four died at 4, 5, 15, and 18
months and four were recent procedures that have short-term
followup. Three were lost to followup at 5, 6 and 7 months,
but were well at the time of last evaluation. We had prior
approval from our institution’s Ofﬁce for Protection of
Research Subjects (UCLA IRB #G08-10-100-01).

(Camarillo, CA). Between 1985 and 1989, these implants
were custom-designed, one-piece casted implants. A rotat-
ing-hinge was utilized in all cases. A one-piece custom tibial
endoprosthesis was implanted in 23 cases (44%), while a
modular endoprosthesis was utilized in 29 (56%). The 51
implants (98%) manufactured by Stryker/Howmedica used
the Kinematic1 rotating-hinge mechanism. The one implant
(2%) manufactured by Techmedica used the Noiles1
rotating-hinge mechanism. Porous extramedullary coating
was applied to the body of the ﬁrst 10 proximal tibial en-
doprostheses. The subsequent 10 endoprostheses were
manufactured without this surface but demonstrated an
alarming incidence of osteolysis and radiolucent lines. We
have previously reported this subset of patients [48]. This
coating was then reapplied to the prosthetic body over a
limited distance (2–3 cm) for the remaining 32 implants in
the series. In the initial custom design, the tibial polyethyl-
ene component was secured by three metal tabs to the
proximal tibial implant. The subsequent design in the early
1990s used a press-ﬁt capture mechanism.

The surgical technique for tumor resection included a
wide surgical margin; tourniquets were never utilized [9].
All resections performed in this series were intraarticular
and intracompartmental. The surgical approach utilized a
longitudinal medial incision over the distal thigh extending
medially toward the ankle and following the juncture of the
anterior compartment with the tibia. Once the tibia was
completely exposed, the level of resection was marked on
the tibia distally with an osteotome. A more distal mark on
the tibia and a mark on the distal femur were made and this
distance measured and recorded. The posterior tibial and
peroneal arteries were identiﬁed in the popliteal space. The
anterior tibial artery and vein were identiﬁed in the prox-
imal calf and the anterior compartment. This vessel was
occasionally sacriﬁced for large, laterally based tumors. If
this was required, a Doppler probe was used to conﬁrm the
presence of blood ﬂow distally with manual compression
on the artery before ligation. The ligamentous structures
were dissected free from their femoral origins and the
posterior capsule was transected. The distal marrow was
sent for frozen-section analysis to ensure a negative mar-
row margin. With the knee ﬂexed, the distal femoral cuts
were performed freehand using a sagittal saw. Once the
frozen section of the distal marrow was reported as nega-
tive, the tibia was reamed over a guidewire to maximize ﬁt
and ﬁll of the distal canal with the prosthetic stem. The trial
endoprosthesis was reduced, and restoration of the prere-
section extremity length was veriﬁed using the marks on
the proximal tibia and femur. The neurovascular bundle
was palpated to ensure there was not excessive tension on
the vessels, and a Doppler probe at the ankle conﬁrmed
the presence of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis
pulses. Before cementation, all patients received 100 mg

Solu-Cortef1 (Pﬁzer, New York, NY) to help protect
against the inﬂammatory effects of fat emboli. The medial
gastrocnemius muscle was dissected free before cementing
the endoprosthetic components and was rotated over the
tibial component. To reconstruct the extensor mechanism,
the joint capsule and patellar tendon were sutured to the
leading edge of the transposed gastrocnemius muscle. A
split-thickness skin graft was then applied to the muscle
ﬂap in all cases.

Postoperatively patients were immobilized either with a
long posterior splint or a cast for 4 weeks and were then
allowed to begin gentle ROM exercises. Warfarin was
administered for 3 weeks (goal international normalized
ratio of 2.0–3.0). On the third postoperative day, patients
were made weightbearing as tolerated with ambulatory
supports, which were used for 6 to 8 weeks. At 4 weeks, the
cast was removed and ROM and motor strengthening
exercises were begun.
Intravenous antistaphylococcal
antibiotics were administered until
the drains were
removed, generally 6 to 8 days after surgery.

Patients were followed every 2 to 3 weeks for the ﬁrst 2
months after surgery. They were then followed quarterly
for 2 years, semiannually for an additional 2 years, and
then annually. Radiographs of the affected limb were
obtained at each postoperative visit, along with quarterly
chest radiographs and semiannual chest CT. Postoperative
function was evaluated for each patient with the use of the
MSTS function score [13].

Data retrieved from the charts included the index diag-
the time of presentation
nosis and disease stage at
(according to the system described by Enneking [12]),
length of followup, postoperative Musculoskeletal Tumor
Society (MSTS) function scores at the time of most recent
followup [13], and any major postoperative events (com-
plications,
revision of
stemmed components,
infection), and local recurrence.
Complications and implant survival data were included for
all patients, including those with short-term followup and
the three patients lost to followup (at time end-points of 5,
6, and 7 months).

Patient, prosthesis, and limb survival rates were deter-
mined using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method [27].
Prosthesis survivorship was evaluated using revision of the
stemmed components for any reason (including mechanical
failure, infection, or local recurrence) as an end point.
Mechanical failure included aseptic loosening or fatigue
fracture of the stemmed tibial or femoral components.
Bushing, axle, and polyethylene failures were analyzed
separately, as they were successfully managed without
the need for revision of major stemmed components.
Statistical analysis was performed using a commercially
available statistics package (SPSS1 Version 11.0; SPSS

years). Three of the six cemented stems revised for aseptic
loosening had an extramedullary porous surface and three
did not. The remaining mechanical stem failures included
single instances of aseptic loosening of the femoral com-
ponent at 7.1 years, fatigue fracture of the femoral condyle
at 13.5 years, and periprosthetic tibial fracture at 18.6 years
postoperatively. A second revision procedure was required
in four of these nine cases of mechanical failure. One
patient required a third revision procedure due to acute
infection. None of the casted (n = 23) or modular forged
stems (n = 29) have experienced fatigue fracture. Failure of
the rotating-hinge mechanism necessitating replacement of
the bushings, axle, tibial bearing, or polyethylene without
revision of the stemmed components occurred in 12 cases
(23.1%) at a mean of 8.9 years postoperatively (range, 2.5–
17.1 years). Of the 12, failure of the tibial polyethylene
capture mechanism occurred in eight (all of which utilized
the original tabbed capture mechanism), standard bushing
failures in two, and single instances of the fatigue fracture
of the axle and tibial bearing component. All nine patients
initially diagnosed with low-grade or aggressive benign
tumors have survived (Table 2). The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-
year disease-speciﬁc survival rates for the 43 patients
diagnosed with high-grade localized disease were 81.2%,
69.9%, 69.9%, and 69.9%, respectively. Survival of con-
temporary modular implants exceeded the 15-year patient
survival among those with high-grade localized disease.
The 29 modular implants demonstrated a trend toward
improved (p = 0.13) survival compared to the 23 custom
designed components, with a 15-year survivorship of
87.5% versus 62.9% (Fig. 2).

recent followup was 82.0% of normal function (mean raw
score, 24.6; range, 4–29). The postoperative ROM on most

abdominus free muscle ﬂap. Deep infection occurred in
three of the 52 patients (5.8%). One patient developed a
deep bacterial infection immediately after the index pro-
cedure and was
successfully treated surgically with
irrigation and de´bridement with retention of the compo-
nents. A second patient with a modular prosthesis
presented with an acute hematogenous infection 2 years
after
the index operation. The cemented stems were
retained, along with an antibiotic spacer, and after 6 weeks
of intravenous antibiotics, the modular components were
replaced successfully. The third patient, who underwent his
initial reconstruction in 1985, experienced a late infection
with Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1990. After multiple
episodes of repeat infection, he ultimately underwent two-
stage reimplantation of a custom-designed endoprosthesis
with crosspin ﬁxation for antirotational control in both the
femoral and tibial stems in 2008. He is currently pain free
and ambulates without supports despite a 90(cid:3) active
extensor lag. Five of the 52 patients (9.6%) ultimately
required amputation after either the index or revision pro-
cedure and were categorized as failed limb salvage efforts.
The reason for amputation was local recurrence in three
patients and single instances of regional metastasis and
intractable pain. A total of 98 procedures were performed
in 52 patients, including all index procedures and all pro-
cedures related to local complications or revisions.

Discussion

Endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal
tibia is
challenging due to a variety of factors. Problems include
the frequently poor residual soft tissue envelope and the
need for reconstruction of the extensor mechanism to either
the prosthesis or allograft. At the 1983 ISOLS meeting in
Vienna, Jean Debousset of France described the use of a
gastrocnemius rotation ﬂap used to cover the proximal
tibial prosthetic implant. This provided excellent coverage
over the prosthesis and an anchorage point for the joint
capsule and patellar tendon attachments. As a result,
prosthetic replacement of the tibia became feasible, since
soft tissue coverage and extensor mechanism attachment
were possible [8, 9, 40, 45]. While the use of this recon-
structive method is now widespread, the available long-
term data report a wide range of implant survival from 22%
to 86% [3, 14, 19, 23, 26, 33, 36, 37, 39, 44, 51, 52, 54].
We therefore raised the following questions: (1) How long
do proximal tibial endoprostheses last? (2) What is the
typical
long-term functional result after proximal tibial
replacement? And (3) what are the complications associ-
ated with endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal
tibia, particularly with respect
tissue
reconstruction?

The limitations of this study include the small patient
to followup. First,
cohort, and the three patients lost
regarding the relatively small cohort, musculoskeletal
tumors of the proximal tibia are rare, making it exceedingly
difﬁcult to amass a large number of patients for prospective
evaluation. While this series appears small, the available
literature reports outcomes for cohorts ranging from seven
to 136 patients over varied followup lengths, employing
widely varied surgical techniques and implants. We report
a relatively uniform cohort of 52 patients who underwent
reconstruction by one surgeon, with one method of exten-
sor mechanism and soft tissue reconstruction. We believe
that the implant survival data of such a uniform cohort
provides a major contribution to the available literature.
The three patients lost to followup were included to capture
all data related to perioperative complications and events.
The lost-to-followup quotient (ratio of patients lost to fol-
lowup to the number of failures reported) [35] was much
less than 1, indicating a low likelihood that these three
patients would substantially affect the data analysis.

Long-term survival of proximal tibial implants varies
widely across studies, possibly due to dissimilarity in
implant design and surgical
technique (Table 3). Our
ﬁndings are similar to previous reports that point to an
improvement in prosthesis longevity among newer forged
modular implants [33, 47]. Although not statistically sig-
niﬁcant, the use of modularity tended to improve 15-year
survivorship to 87.5% from 15- and 20-year survivorship of
63% and 35% seen with the initial custom-cased compo-
nents; the study may have been underpowered to show any
real difference. Similar to other series of cemented endo-
prosthetic reconstruction, the major mode of stem failure
seen was aseptic loosening (Fig. 3). The use of an extra-
medullary porous ingrowth surface (Fig. 4) was associated
with a lower incidence of aseptic loosening, as we have
previously reported [48]. Additionally, improvements in
the polyethylene locking mechanism resulted in fewer
cases of failure of the articulating surface.

Our immediate use of a continuous passive motion
machine in the 1980s resulted in a large extensor lag, and
after personal communication (JJE) with Jean Debousset
(1987), this practice was discontinued in favor of immo-
bilization for a period of 4 weeks. Due to wide variation in
reporting methods and subjective evaluation criteria, it is
difﬁcult
to compare ROM data, strength testing, and
extensor mechanism function across study cohorts. Func-
tion after proximal
tibial endoprosthetic reconstruction
varies in the literature from 60% to 90% of normal func-
tion, according to MSTS scores (Table 3). We report an
overall MSTS score of 82.0%, despite a mean active
extension lag of 17.9(cid:3). Passively, almost all patients were
able to achieve full extension (mean 1.4(cid:3) short of full
extension). These data support the notion that, even with an

Fig. 4A–B (A) The initial implant design used for the ﬁrst 10 cases
in this series featured extensive extramedullary porous coating with
the aim of encouraging bone ingrowth. The coating was removed after
bone ingrowth did not occur. The subsequent 10 cases were
manufactured without this surface and were noted to demonstrate
increased radiographic radiolucent lines and osteolysis. Three of the
10 implants (30%) without this surface demonstrated aseptic loosen-
ing, while only three of 42 implants (7.1%) with extramedullary
coating showed signs of loosening. (B) An intraoperative photograph
at the time of implant revision demonstrates soft tissue ingrowth into

provide a barrier that functions to limit access of wear debris to the
bone-cement interface.

active extensor lag after insertion of the residual patellar
tendon into the rotated gastrocnemius ﬂap, most patients
remain able to achieve full extension during swing-through
phase of gait. Recurvatum is avoided by engagement of the
extensor stop on the femoral prosthesis, providing a stable
platform for walking. Formal gait analysis to better deﬁne
the mechanisms of ambulation in this complex patient
population would certainly improve our understanding of
the biomechanics involved and likely lead to enhancements
in implant design.

and neurovascular compromise (Table 3). The most com-
mon complication encountered in this series was related to
wound healing, although only three patients experienced a
deep infection involving the prosthesis. The purpose of the
soft tissue reconstructive method utilized in this series was
to permit wide tumor resection while providing reliable
rates of wound healing. Orthopaedic oncologists in the
1970s advocated for
if
unsuccessful, could be converted to an amputation level no
higher than would have been necessary to achieve local
control initially. Amputation rates after limb salvage pro-
cedures of the proximal tibia vary from 2.3% to 23.1%,
although the level of amputation is not regularly reported.
Five of 52 patients (9.6%) treated at our institution ulti-
mately required an amputation, none of which were
performed for wound-related issues. The only amputation
performed at a level higher than would be needed at the
time of initial presentation was in the single patient with
regional thigh metastasis who underwent a hip disarticu-
lation. All of the mechanical failures and complications
related to infections or wound healing in this series were
successfully revised, and all maintain successful
limb
salvage.

Our data suggest for patients with low-grade or benign
disease with a normal
life expectancy, reoperation or
revision is likely to be necessary. Survival of contemporary
modular implants exceeds the 15-year patient survival
among those with high-grade localized disease (Fig. 5).
This further encourages our continued use of cemented
