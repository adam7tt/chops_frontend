[3, 41.

Limb salvage reconstruction has three goals:
The local recurrence rate should be no greater
than that with amputation, the procedure should
not delay the administrationof adjuvantor neo
adjuvant therapy, and the reconstruction should
be enduring and not associated with many local
complications

[ I , 2].
