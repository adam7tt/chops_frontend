Abstract
Background As the life expectancy of patients with
musculoskeletal
long-term studies of
endoprosthetic reconstructions are necessary to establish
realistic expectations for the implants and compare them to
other reconstruction approaches.
Questions/purposes
(1) What is the long-term survival of
cemented bipolar proximal femoral replacements? (2) How
does prosthesis survival compare to patient survival among
patients with Stage I, II, and III disease? (3) Do modular
implants outperform custom-built prostheses? (4) Do some
proximal
replacements require conversion to
THA?
Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed all 86
proximal femoral replacements used for tumor recon-
struction from 1982 to 2008. Primary diagnoses were 43
high-grade tumors (IIA/IIB), 20 low-grade tumors (IA/IB

or benign), and 23 with metastatic disease. We reviewed
prosthesis survival, patient survival, complication rates,
functional outcomes, and rates of conversion to THA.
Results Five of 86 patients (5.8%) required revision of
the femoral component. Five-, 10-and 20-year implant
survivorships were 93%, 84%, and 56%, respectively. All
patients with low-grade disease survived; the 5-year sur-
vival rate for patients with metastatic disease was 16%; the
5-, 10-, and 20-year survival for IIA/IIB patients was 54%,
50%, and 44%, respectively. Five of 86 patients (5.8%)
underwent conversion to THA for groin pain.
Conclusions Cemented
femoral
bipolar
replacements after
resection proved a durable
reconstruction technique. The implants outlived patients
with metastatic disease and high-grade localized disease
while patients with low-grade disease outlived their
implants. The survival of modular prostheses was compa-
rable to that of older, one-piece custom designs.

Introduction

Austin Moore and Harold Bohlman [22] published the ﬁrst
case of endoprosthetic reconstruction for a bone neoplasm
of the proximal femur in 1943. Nonetheless, amputation
remained the mainstay of surgical treatment for proximal
femoral tumors until the advent of doxorubicin and meth-
otrexate in the mid-1970s [16]. Despite the fact that limb
salvage is now performed in up to 80% to 90% of patients
with musculoskeletal tumors, there remains debate as to
which reconstruction modality allows the greatest function
and is most durable [4, 6]. Allograft-prosthetic composite

and endoprostheses are the two main reconstruction alter-
natives, but the low incidence of these tumors coupled
with often short-term patient followup has made deﬁnitive
recommendations elusive [2, 14]. Critics of both recon-
struction modalities cite unacceptably high rates of
infection and implant failure [2, 4]. As long-term patient
survival rates continue to improve, concerns regarding
long-term durability of both constructs have surfaced.

It is difﬁcult to draw conclusions from the existing
literature on long-term outcomes of bipolar proximal fem-
oral replacements (PFRs) because most of the reports are
small, heterogeneous cohorts with limited followup [1, 12,
26]. Bickels et al. [1] reported a 7.7% revision rate in 39
PFRs at a mean followup of 80 months, but the cohort was
small and included both unipolar and bipolar prostheses.
Menendez et al. [21] reported a 3.2% revision rate in 62
bipolar PFRs, but the mean followup was only 18 months.
Recently, Finstein et al. [11] reviewed a larger cohort of 62
bipolar PFRs in tumor patients and demonstrated good
long-term survivorship of the prosthesis (19.4% revision
rate at a mean of 59.2 months’ followup). However, none of
these studies has reviewed prosthetic survival stratiﬁed by
tumor stage, a major factor in providing prognostic infor-
mation to the individual patient. Additionally, all prior
reports describe a surprising 0% conversion rate from
bipolar PFR to THA in tumor patients [1, 12, 21, 26].

We therefore asked the following questions: (1) What is
the long-term survival of cemented bipolar PFRs? (2) How
does prosthesis survival compare to patient survival among
patients with Stage I, II, and III disease, respectively? (3)
Do newer, modular implants outperform older, custom-
built prostheses? (4) What are the limb salvage rate,
functional outcome, and complication rate for PFRs? (5)
Do bipolar prostheses require conversion to THAs?

Patients and Methods

total

We retrospectively identiﬁed all 106 bipolar PFRs
implanted in 98 patients between December 1982 and
December 2008. Of the 106 implants, 20 were excluded:
nine were revision procedures, seven were performed for
reasons other than tumor (ie,
joint revisions and
trauma), and four were expandable prostheses used in
skeletally immature patients. The expandable prostheses
were placed with the intent to perform multiple expansions
and/or revision procedures at a later date, and these results
have been previously reported [7]. The cohort was there-
fore formed by the remaining 86 primary cemented bipolar
PFRs performed in skeletally mature adults with primary
tumors. The mean age was 44.5 years (range, 10–83 years)
at the time of surgery. The diagnoses at the time of the
index procedures are listed (Table 1). Of the 86 patients, 46

the 86 patients were lost to followup at 5, 6, 12, 21, 24, 80,
and 86 months. The minimum followup was 3 months
(mean,
3–291 months; median,

the 86 implants, 56 were manufactured by
Stryker/Howmedica (Mahwah, NJ), 19 by Techmedica
Inc (Camarillo, CA), eight by DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc
(Warsaw, IN), two by Intermedics Orthopedics, Inc (Austin,
TX), and one by Zimmer, Inc (Warsaw, IN). From 1982 to
1990, 32 implanted prostheses were custom-designed one-
piece implants designed by the senior authors (JMK, JJE).
The remaining 54 implants since 1990 were manufactured
using forged stems and titanium modular segments.

Bipolar PFRs were used as the exclusive reconstruction
method after tumor resection from the proximal femur
since 1982, as our institution had a poor experience with
allograft
reconstruction [6]. Contraindications included
tumors with extension prohibiting distal femoral ﬁxation or
adequate soft tissue coverage for a functional extremity.
Since 1992, a displaced pathologic fracture has been con-
sidered a relative contraindication.

Preoperative planning consisted of a comprehensive
history and physical examination,
routine laboratory
assessment, high-quality plain radiographs, and a CT and/
or MRI to determine the local extent of the lesion. Neo-
adjuvant
radiation was used in 23 patients: nine for
metastatic disease, 10 with localized high-grade Ewing’s
sarcoma,

sarcoma, and two with localized high-grade osteosarcoma
who presented with a fracture. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
was used in 42 patients: one with low-grade osteosarcoma
with pathologic fracture, 36 with high-grade localized
disease, and ﬁve with metastatic disease.

All surgery was performed by a single surgeon (JJE).
The surgical technique was identical in all cases and fol-
lowed standard principles of surgical oncology [5, 25]. An
extended lateral incision was used for all surgeries and
appropriate tissues were retained over the tumor in an
attempt to obtain a wide tumor margin. Tumors with large
extraosseous extension required additional soft
tissue
resection. The lateral incision was extended to the anterior
superior iliac spine for tumors with anterior soft tissue
extension; for posterior tumors, the incision was extended
from the greater trochanter to the posterior iliac crest for
tumors. The fascia lata was split in line with its ﬁbers and
the vastus lateralis was then released proximally. The
dissection was continued anterior and posterior to expose
the hip. The interval between the quadriceps and the biceps
was identiﬁed and perforating vessels were ligated. The
bulk of the quadriceps was then reﬂected anteriorly off
the femur, the biceps muscle reﬂected posteriorly, and the
external
rotators transected. The abductors were then
released and reﬂected proximally, and the joint capsule
incised. The hip was then dislocated. The level of resection
was marked on the femur with an osteotome. After the
osteotomy was completed, the distal marrow was sampled
and a frozen-section analysis performed to conﬁrm the
absence of tumor at the level of the osteotomy. The ace-
tabulum was then sized and a bipolar component was
selected. The femoral canal was reamed, cleaned, and
dried. If the tip of the stem ended within the diaphysis of
the femur, a cement restrictor was used. In cases in which
the stem ended in the distal 8 cm of the metaphysis, cross-
stem pin ﬁxation was used (Fig. 1). A trial reduction with
all components was then performed. Before cementation,
100 mg Solu-Cortef1 (Pﬁzer, New York, NY) was given
intravenously to protect against the inﬂammatory effects of
fat emboli that can occur during cementation. Antibiotic-
impregnated cement was used in all cases. With the pros-
thesis now assembled, the stem was inserted slowly into the
femoral canal with the intent
to achieve 20(cid:3) of neck
anteversion. After hip relocation, leg lengths were once
again veriﬁed, and the leg was taken through a ROM to
conﬁrm stability. Modular neck segments were used to
increase or decrease leg length accordingly. Meticulous
closures were performed as the retained capsule was
secured around the femoral neck with nonabsorbable
suture. The quadriceps was then pulled over the prosthesis
and the proximal portion was sutured to the external rota-
tors and to the remaining biceps muscle. The abductors
were pulled distally out
to length and, with the hip

abducted, sutured over the vastus lateralis and vastus
medialis origins. No vigorous attempts were made to suture
the abductors to the prosthesis to simulate anatomic tro-
chanteric attachment. Deep and superﬁcial drains were
placed and the wound closed.

Postoperatively, patients were originally placed on bed
rest for 4 weeks. Over time, this period of bed rest has been
reduced to 7 to 10 days. Antibiotics were continued until
the drains were removed. Warfarin was used for antico-
agulation postoperatively for 21 days with a target
international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Several days
before discharge, patients began ambulation in an abduc-
tion hip brace, which was encouraged for 3 months, at
which point weightbearing was permitted as tolerated.
Isometric exercises were encouraged initially, along with
passive ROM. Abduction strengthening exercises were not
begun until 6 weeks and were then carried on for 3 to
6 months.

Patients were seen in clinic 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks
postoperatively and then every 3 months for the ﬁrst
2 years. At
these visits, all patients underwent wound
checks and ROM testing, AP and lateral radiographs of the
proximal femur were taken, and in patients with neoplastic
disorders, a chest radiograph was taken. Chest CT scans
were performed quarterly for patients with high-grade
localized disease. From 2 to 4 years from surgery, patients
were followed biannually with a clinical examination and
hip and chest radiographs. Chest CT scans were obtained
biannually in this group. After 4 years, the patients were
seen annually with the same physical examination and
radiographs in perpetuity. Cross-sectional imaging such as
CT and MRI was only used at the operative site if the
clinical examination and/or radiographs were suggestive of
local relapse.

scale

Functional outcome was assessed using the system
adopted by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) for
the functional evaluation of reconstructive procedures after
skeletal resection [8]. The MSTS scoring system is a cli-
nician-scored 30-point
six
categories (pain, stability, strength, appearance, accep-
tance, and function) with scores of 0 to 5. Scores were
considered excellent if ﬁve of six variables scored 5 points,
good if ﬁve variables scored 3 points or more, fair if ﬁve of
six factors scored 1 or more points, and poor if two or more
factors scored 0. Scores were available for 53 of the 86
patients.

assessing each of

Prosthesis survivorship was deﬁned by revision of the
cemented component for any reason (including mechanical
failure, infection, or local recurrence) as an end point.
Mechanical failure included aseptic loosening or fatigue
fracture of the femoral component. The rate of successful
limb salvage was determined using amputation for any
reason as an end point. All other repeat surgical proce-
dures,
including conversion to THA, were considered
separately, as the cemented stem was retained.

To determine disease-speciﬁc patient and prosthetic
survival rates, the study cohort of 86 reconstructions was
divided into three groups deﬁned by the staging system
described by Enneking [8, 9]: Group 1 (n = 20) included
those with low-grade malignancy (Stage IA or IB) or
benign conditions; Group 2 (n = 43) consisted of those

Table 2. Patients requiring revision of femoral component (n = 5)

with high-grade localized disease (Stage IIA or IIB); and
Group 3 (n = 23) consisted of those with Stage III primary
sarcomas, lymphoma, myeloma, or metastatic disease.

Patient, prosthesis, and limb survival rates were deter-
mined using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method [15].
For the purpose of the Kaplan-Meier analysis, all patients
were evaluated based on their status at their most recent
clinic visit. Therefore, patients who died of disease with an
intact implant were counted as nonrevised implants at the
time point of their last clinic visit. Patients who were
eventually lost to followup were included in the statistical
evaluation based on their status at their last clinic visit. In
either case, the analysis included the contribution of these
individuals only up to the point of their last known status,
ie, length of followup. Survival curves were compared
using the log-rank method [19]. Statistical analysis was
performed using a commercially available statistics pack-
age (SPSS1 Version 11.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Results

Five of the 86 patients (5.8%) underwent revision of their
prostheses, as deﬁned as removal of the femoral compo-
nent. Three underwent revision for aseptic loosening, one
for deep infection, and one underwent removal of a well-
ﬁxed stem because of osteolysis at the prosthesis-stem
junction at
the time of conversion to THA (Table 2).
Overall prosthesis survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were
thus 97%, 84%, and 56%, respectively (Table 3).

Patient survival was vastly different among patients with
Stage I, II, and III disease. For patients with low-grade
tumors (n = 20), there was 100% disease-speciﬁc survival
at 20 years. The 5-year disease-speciﬁc survival rate for
Stage III primary sarcoma, metastatic tumors, lymphoma,
and multiple myeloma (n = 23) was 15.5%, and no
patients in this group survived to 10 years. The 5-, 10-, and
20-year disease-speciﬁc survival rates for patients diag-
nosed with high-grade localized disease (n = 43) were
54%, 50%, and 44%,
respectively (Table 3; Fig. 2).
Comparing these rates to the prosthetic survival rates, we
found the reconstructions outlived patients with metastatic
disease (Stage III) and high-grade localized disease (Stage

We found no difference (p = 0.582) in prosthesis sur-

One of the 86 patients (1.2%) underwent amputation, a
hemipelvectomy performed at 87.7 months for a local
recurrence. The remaining 85 patients (98.8%) maintained
a viable limb, producing a 95.7% limb survival rate at
20 years. Six other patients had local recurrences treated
with palliative care. Functional evaluation data were

postoperatively (range, 7–288 months). The mean MSTS
score was 87.0% (mean raw score, 26.2; range, 13–30), and
function was considered excellent in 15 patients (28.3%),
good in 29 (54.7%), fair in nine (17.0%), and poor in
none. Four of 86 patients (4.6%) experienced systemic
complications (nonfatal pulmonary embolism, posttrans-
fusion hepatitis, distant acute myelogenous leukemia, and
postoperative perforated diverticulum). Eighteen local
complications occurred in 16 patients (18.6%) (Table 4).

Dislocation occurred in four patients (4.6%). The single
cases of wound dehiscence and seroma formation were
surgically de´brided in the immediate postoperative period
and required no further care. The single case of deep
infection was in an immunosuppressed lymphoma patient
85 months after her index surgery and was managed with a

staged prosthesis exchange. We noted no mechanical fati-
gue fractures or nerve palsies.

Five of 86 (5.8%) patients underwent conversion to
THA for groin pain (Table 5). All patients reported reso-
lution of symptoms with the revision procedure. None of
the 23 patients who underwent adjuvant radiation therapy
required conversion to THA.

Discussion

As advances in chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and limb
salvage have led to survival improvements in patients with
malignancies of the proximal femur, successful surgical
intervention has been redeﬁned to include not only pres-
ervation of life and limb but also a durable, reliable, and
functional extremity. Long-term outcome studies of
cemented bipolar PFRs are thus needed to evaluate these
prostheses and compare them to other
reconstruction
modalities available. Speciﬁcally, questions of prosthetic
survival as compared to patient survival, complications of
the surgery, and conversions to THA must be answered to
develop realistic expectations for the implants. While
studies of
in oncology patients
are notoriously difﬁcult due to often shortened life

expectancies, this study of 86 patients has a mean of fol-
lowup of more than 65 months.

Our study is associated with several limitations. First,
we lacked control patients managed with allograft-com-
posite implants for comparison. As our early institutional
allograft experience was poor [6], endoprosthetic recon-
struction has been used exclusively at our institution since
1982. Despite this, our study provides outcomes to which
institutions that perform allograft-composite can compare
their results. Second, we compared an aggregate prosthesis
survival curve to patient survival curves for patients with
Stage I, II, and III disease. We believe the similarity in
prosthesis survival among the different tumor stage groups
allows this (Table 3) and the aggregate prosthesis survival
curve provides the most robust curve for comparison.

Our overall revision rate of 5.8% compares to that of
other reports of PFRs. Bickels et al. [1] reported a revision
rate of 7.7% at a mean of 80 months while Farid et al. [10]
reported a revision rate of 13.5% with a median followup
of 146 months. Menendez et al. [21] reported a 3.2%
revision rate, but followup was only 18.1 months. In their
review of bipolar PFRs, Finstein et al. [11] reported a
revision rate of 19.4% (Table 6).

is the patient

By stratifying patients according to disease-speciﬁc life
expectancy, our results help to answer a key question
regarding prosthesis longevity:
likely to
outlive his or her prosthesis? For patients with Stage IIA or
IIB disease or patients with Stage III disease, the survival
of the implants exceeded patient survival. Patients with
low-grade or benign disease, however, outlived their
prostheses. Therefore, these patients should be counseled
preoperatively that, while bipolar PFRs provide a durable
reconstruction, they likely would require a revision surgery
at some point in their lifetime.

We found no difference in survival between newer,
modular prostheses and older, one-piece custom prosthe-
ses. While Finstein et al.
found modular PFRs
outperformed custom designs, our 10-year survival rates

[11]

were nearly identical
(87.4% and 85.7%). While our
sample size of 32 custom prostheses was larger than the 10
described by Finstein et al. [11], additional studies will be
required to provide a deﬁnitive answer to this question.

Our high limb preservation rate (98.8%) and good
functional results (83% good or excellent MSTS scores) are
consistent with the literature. Malawar et al. [20] and
Finstein et al. [11] both also reported one single case of
amputation in their respective cohorts. Bickels et al. [1]
reported 87% good or excellent results in 39 patients, while
Finstein et al. [11] reported an MSTS mean of 21.3 with
71% good or excellent results in 13 patients. While the
subjectivity of the MSTS system and the variation of
reporting methods make comparison across studies difﬁcult
[18],
these results indicate reliably good to excellent
function can be obtained with PFRs. It should be noted,
however, we had six additional cases of local relapse
before 1992 treated palliatively, of which ﬁve presented
with pathologic fractures. This led us to conclude local
control cannot be consistently achieved with this procedure
in patients presenting with a displaced pathologic fracture
due to tumor seeding of the surrounding compartment;
therefore, since 1992, these patients were recommended
amputation for local control.

Five of 86 patients (5.8%) required conversion to THA
for groin pain and/or acetabular cartilage loss. While not
reported in the oncology literature,
the limitations of
bipolar hemiarthroplasties have been well documented in
other patient populations [23, 24]. In patients with degen-
erative arthritis, Pellegrini et al. [24] reported a 12%
conversion to THA in long-term followup. In patients with
hemiarthroplasty for fracture, Ong et al. [23] reported an
18% rate of moderate to severe groin pain. In osteonecrosis
patients with bipolar hemiarthroplasty, incidences of groin
pain have been reported from 12% to 42% [3, 13, 17],
which is perhaps the best comparison group as they
resemble tumor patients in that they are generally younger
and have no pathology of the acetabulum. Ito et al. [13]

reported 6.3% of bipolar hemiarthroplasties for osteone-
crosis required conversion to THA. The ﬁve patients in our
study who required conversion to THA were younger than
our average patient (mean 27.5 versus 44.5 years) and
perhaps placed more physical demands on the reconstruc-
tion. Three of
receive adjuvant
chemotherapy and all ﬁve did not receive radiation, sug-
gesting these are not predisposing factors for conversion to
THA in our experience.

This study represents the largest reported series of
cemented bipolar PFRs implanted for tumors. By stratify-
ing patients by tumor grade and stage, the data demonstrate
patients with metastatic and high-grade tumors are unlikely
to require revision surgery, whereas patients with low-
grade tumors will likely outlive their prosthesis. The 5.8%
conversion rate to THA, which is unique to this series,
suggests groin pain and acetabular erosion be carefully
evaluated in patients who have undergone bipolar PFRs.
Still, with a 5.8% overall revision rate and a 99% limb
salvage rate, we conclude cemented bipolar PFRs provide a
durable method of reconstruction for the vast majority of
patients with musculoskeletal tumors.
