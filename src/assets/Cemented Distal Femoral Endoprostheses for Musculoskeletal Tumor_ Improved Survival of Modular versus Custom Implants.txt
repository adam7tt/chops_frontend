Abstract
Background Advocates of newer implant designs cite
high rates of aseptic loosening and failure as reasons to
abandon traditional cemented endoprosthetic reconstruc-
tion of the distal femur.
Questions/purposes We asked whether newer, modular
distal
femoral components had improved survivorship
compared with older, custom-casted designs.
Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 254
patients who underwent distal
femoral endoprosthetic
reconstruction. We excluded two patients with cementless
implants, 27 with expandable prostheses, and 39 who had a
nontumor diagnosis. This left 186 patients: 101 with older
custom implants and 85 with contemporary modular
implants. The minimum followup was 1 month (mean,
96.0 months; range, 1–336 months). The tumor was clas-
siﬁed as Stage IIA/IIB in 122 patients, Stage IA/IB or
benign in 43, and Stage III or metastatic in 21.

Results Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed overall 10-, 20-,
and 25-year implant survival rates of 77%, 58%, and 50%,
respectively, using revision of the stemmed components as
an end point. The 85 modular components had a greater 15-
year survivorship than the 101 custom-designed implants:
93.7% versus 51.7%, respectively. Thirty-ﬁve stemmed
components (18.8%) were revised for aseptic loosening in
22 patients, implant fatigue fracture in 10, infection in two,
and local recurrence in one.
Conclusions Cemented modular
rotating-hinge distal
femoral endoprostheses demonstrated improved survivorship
compared with custom-casted implants during this three-
decade experience. Patients with low-grade disease and long-
term survivors of high-grade localized disease should expect
at least one or more revision procedures in their lifetime.

Introduction

Before the 1970s, the majority of high-grade musculo-
skeletal tumors involving the distal femur were treated with
transfemoral amputation owing to an unacceptably high
rate of recurrence associated with local resection [10, 19,
31, 47]. As effective chemotherapeutic regimens were
developed, limb salvage using various techniques gained
popularity among orthopaedic oncologists [1, 11, 19, 20,
24, 37, 45, 49, 60, 69]. Today, with effective neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, limb salvage is indicated in as much as 90%
of patients with musculoskeletal malignancies involving
the distal femur [6, 7, 14, 44, 53–55, 57].

Numerous studies document relatively high implant
survival after limb salvage for tumors involving the distal

femur [3, 4, 8, 26, 27, 29, 35, 43, 44, 50, 54, 55, 57, 61, 71].
Studies that are available, however, do not stratify patients
on the basis of tumor grade, stage of disease, or life
expectancy to deﬁne the disease-speciﬁc survival of
implants. This makes it difﬁcult for surgeons to accurately
predict how long the implants will last for a given patient
population and life expectancy. Additionally,
there are
limited data available with which to compare implant
survival of contemporary modular implant designs with
older custom-designed implants no longer in use [8, 44, 48,
70]. Critics of a cemented endoprosthetic reconstruction
technique cite rates of aseptic loosening from 8.4% to
greater than 30% [2, 30, 38, 63] as the main rationale for
abandoning its use in favor of newer designs.

femoral

Given the paucity of

long-term data concerning
cemented distal
implants and the heightened
interest in alternate ﬁxation designs, we sought to answer
the following four questions: (1) Do newer cemented
modular
implant designs have improved survivorship
compared with older custom-designed components? (2)
Does tumor grade or stage inﬂuence implant survival? (3)
What
long-term functional result after a
cemented distal femoral replacement? (4) What are the
complications associated with this technique?

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic and paper
charts of all 254 patients who underwent cemented distal
femoral endoprosthetic reconstructions for musculoskeletal
tumors between December 1980 and December 2008. We
excluded 68 patients: 39 patients had distal
femoral
reconstructions or a diagnosis other than musculoskeletal
tumor; 27 with a tumor-related diagnosis were skeletally
immature and underwent distal femoral reconstruction with
the intent to perform multiple expansion procedures at a
later
prosthesis
exchange; two patients underwent reconstruction with a
cementless implant. We previously reported our results of
expandable and cementless implants for tumors of the
distal femur [16, 17, 36, 64] and did not include them in the
current analysis. These exclusions left 186 patients: 98
(53%) males and 88 (47%) females. Their mean age at the
time of surgery was 29.0 years (range, 12–79 years). The
186 patients were analyzed overall and according to
implant type. We further divided the 186 patients into three
subgroups based on disease grade or stage: Group 1
(n = 43) were patients with low-grade malignancy (Stage
IA or IB), parosteal osteosarcoma, or benign diagnoses;
Group 2 (n = 122) was comprised of patients with high-
grade localized disease (Stage IIA or IIB); and Group 3

metastatic carcinoma to the distal femur, and the single
cases of myeloma and lymphoma (Table 1). The latter
group was treated as a single cohort owing to similarity in
life expectancy among patients with these four diagnoses.
At the most recent followup, 65 of the 186 patients had
died (35%). The minimum followup was 1 month (mean,
96 months; range, 1–336 months; median, 54.5 months)
for all patients and 1 month (mean, 130.4 months; range,
1–336 months)
the 121 surviving patients. Eight
patients were lost to followup but were well at the time of
the last evaluation (range, 3–13 months). No patients were
recalled speciﬁcally for
review study. We
obtained prior approval from our institution’s Ofﬁce for
Protection of Research Subjects (UCLA IRB #G08-10-
100-01).

Implants were manufactured by one of three companies:
Stryker/Howmedica (Mahwah, NJ), Techmedica (Camarillo,
CA), and Dow-Corning Wright Corp (Arlington, TN).
All implants used a rotating-hinge knee mechanism. The 156
implants (83.9%) manufactured by Stryker/Howmedica
used the KinematicTM rotating-hinge mechanism [33]. The
28 implants (15.1%) manufactured by Techmedica used the
NoilesTM rotating hinge, whereas the two (1.1%) manufac-
tured by Dow-Corning Wright used the Lacey rotating-hinge
knee (Figs. 1, 2). Initially, the ﬁrst 101 (54.3%) prostheses
were custom designed by two of the senior authors (JMK,
JJE) as a one-piece femoral component [56]. Seventy-three
of 101 custom implants were Co-Cr-Mo alloy components
manufactured by Howmedica. The bodies were casted using

(systemic or local complications, repeat surgery for any
reason, revision of stemmed components, and/or local
recurrence).

All endoprosthetic reconstructions were performed by
the same surgeon (JJE), and all tumor resections followed
generally accepted oncologic principles [7, 12, 14, 15]. A
longitudinal medial
incision extended from the tibial
tubercle proximally following the course of the sartorius
muscle, and the neurovascular bundle was identiﬁed and
protected. Tourniquets were never used. All previous open
biopsy sites were left in continuity with the resected mass;
needle biopsy sites were ignored. The femoral and tibial
osteotomies were made with the intention that postrecon-
struction leg lengths would be equal. A rotating-hinge knee
mechanism was used in all cases that
incorporated an
8-mm all-polyethylene nonmetal-backed tibial component.
The distance between the distal end of the metal femoral
component and the undersurface of the all-polyethylene
tibial component when assembled was 17 mm. To ensure
leg length equality, the femoral osteotomy was made 1 cm
longer than the femoral component length, and 7 mm of
proximal tibia was resected. The location of the patella
relative to the joint line was never a conscious consider-
ation. The level of resection was marked on the femur
proximally with an osteotome, followed by a slightly more
proximal mark on the femur and a mark on the proximal
tibia (distal to the level of resection). The distance between
the latter two marks was measured and recorded. This
preresection distance should equal the postreconstruction
distance to ensure limb length equality. A ﬁnal mark was
placed at the most anterior aspect of the femur to ensure
proper femoral component rotation as the location of the
linea aspera was not always exactly posterior.

After the femoral osteotomy, the proximal marrow was
sent for frozen-section analysis to conﬁrm a negative
marrow margin. A trial tibial component was placed, and
in all cases, an intraoperative radiograph was obtained to
ensure placement perpendicular to the mechanical axis of
the tibia. The trial hinge mechanism was reduced, and
restoration of the preresection extremity length and rota-
tion were veriﬁed using marks previously made on the
proximal tibia and femur. The neurovascular bundle was
palpated to ensure there was not excessive tension on the
vessels, and a Doppler probe at the ankle conﬁrmed the
presence of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses.
We routinely used antibiotic-impregnated cement for all
endoprosthetic reconstructions. The all-polyethylene tibial
and patellar components were cemented ﬁrst, followed by
the femoral component separately. All patients were
administered 100 mg Solu-Cortef1 (Pﬁzer Inc, New York,
NY) before placement of the femoral component, and the
prosthesis was introduced slowly to avoid causing a fat
embolism.

the lost-wax method and used from 1980 to 1985 is shown. The stem,
based on the Zickel nail design, was welded to the body. (B) An
extramedullary porous coating was added to the prosthesis used from
1985 to 1990, which acts as a scaffolding for soft tissue ingrowth.
This presumably protects the stem from debris wear and may reduce
aseptic loosening. (C) A contemporary modular endoprosthesis used
since 1990 features titanium segments and Co-Cr-Mo alloy Morse

the lost-wax method, and the casted stems, based on the
Zickel nail design, were welded to the body. All 28 of the
Techmedica components were manufactured completely
from titanium. In 1990, modular endoprostheses were
introduced and subsequently used in 85 patients (45.7%).
Conventional nonmetal-backed polyethylene tibial compo-
nents were used in all cases. All patellae were resurfaced
using a nonmetal-backed all-polyethylene single central-
pegged component.

Before the introduction of

the continuous passive
motion (CPM) machine, patients initially were immobi-
lized in a cast for 2 to 3 weeks before physical therapy.
Since the introduction of the CPM machine in the early
1980s, all patients were placed into a CPM machine in the
operating room. Motion was commenced from –5(cid:3) exten-
sion to 30(cid:3) to 45(cid:3) ﬂexion and gradually increased to greater
than 90(cid:3) ﬂexion before discharge. A towel roll under the
heel was used three times daily for 1 hour to ensure full
extension was achieved. On the third postoperative day,
patients were made weightbearing as
tolerated with
ambulatory supports and a knee immobilizer, which were
used for 6 to 8 weeks. The CPM machine was used at home
for 12 hours a day for 1 month to help ensure maximum
ﬂexion was achieved.

Patients were followed every 2 to 3 weeks for the ﬁrst
2 months after surgery,
then on a quarterly basis for
2 years, semiannually for an additional 2 years, and
annually thereafter. Radiographs of the affected limb were
obtained at each postoperative visit, along with quarterly
chest radiographs and semiannual chest CT. Postoperative
function was evaluated for each patient using the Muscu-
loskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) function score [23]. One
hundred sixty of the 186 patients (86.0%) were available

for functional evaluation and did not undergo amputation
during the followup period.

Patient and prosthesis survival rates and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) were determined for all three groups using
the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method [34]. Patient sur-
vival was analyzed using death attributable to disease
progression as an end point. Prosthesis survivorship was
determined for custom and modular implants separately
using revision of the stemmed components for any reason
as an end point. For purposes of implant survival, we did
not include surgery attributable to failure of the bushings,
the axle, or the metal tibial bearing component, all of
which were managed successfully without the need for
revision of major stemmed components.
Implant and
patient survival curves for the two types of implants and
three grades or stages of malignancy were compared using
the log-rank method [42]. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using a commercially available statistics package
(R, Version 2.9.0, The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results

Modular implants had greater survivorship (p = 0.011)
than those of a custom design, with a 15-year survivorship
rate of 93.7% versus 51.7% (Fig. 3). Of the 186 index
procedures, 35 stemmed components
(18.8%) were
revised: 32 revisions were performed owing to mechanical
failure, whereas an additional three revisions were neces-
sary owing to nonmechanical complications. Thirty-one
custom-casted stems were revised; 19 were revised for
aseptic loosening of the femoral stem, nine for fatigue

(Group 1, n = 43)

prosthesis survival rates at 10, 20, and 25 years were
77.2%, 57.9%, and 50.2%, respectively (Fig. 4; Table 2).
Modular implant survival was greater (p = 0.001) than
patient survival for those in disease Groups 2 and 3. All
patients initially diagnosed with low-grade or aggressive
benign tumors
survived (Fig. 5;
Table 2). The 10-, 20-, and 25-year disease-speciﬁc sur-
vival rates for patients diagnosed with high-grade localized
disease (Group 2) were 57.7%, 56.0%, and 56.0%,
respectively (Fig. 6; Table 2). The 5- and 10-year disease-
speciﬁc survival rates for patients diagnosed with Stage III
lymphoma, and myeloma
sarcomas, metastatic disease,
(Group 3) were 25.6% and 0%,
respectively (Fig. 7;
Table 2).

Among the 160 patients for whom we had functional
evaluations and who retained their implants,
the mean
postoperative MSTS score was 86.7% (mean score, 26.0;
range, 11–29). The postoperative ROM on ﬁnal assessment
revealed mean ﬂexion of 110.0(cid:3) (range, 45(cid:3)–140(cid:3)), mean
passive extension to 1.3(cid:3) (range, 0(cid:3)–40(cid:3)), and mean active
extension lag of 6.9(cid:3) (range, 0(cid:3)–120(cid:3)). A postoperative
ﬂexion contracture was observed in seven patients, with a
mean value of 10.0(cid:3) (range, 5(cid:3)–40(cid:3)).

Seven systemic

complications occurred in seven
patients, including four cardiac arrhythmias, and single
cases of chemotherapy-related fungal sepsis, acute leuke-
mia, and steroid-induced avascular necrosis of multiple
joints. One hundred four local complications occurred in 88
patients; a single complication occurred in 72 patients, and
16 patients experienced multiple complications. Compli-
cations included mechanical failure in 54 (29.0%; Fig. 8),

fracture, two for infection, and one for local recurrence.
Only four of 85 forged modular components were revised:
three for aseptic loosening and one for a fatigue fracture of
a casted (not forged) Morse taper component. There were
no stem fractures among forged modular implants. Failure
of the rotating-hinge mechanism necessitated replacement
of the bushings and/or axle without revision of the stem-
med components in 22 patients (11.8%) at a mean of
159.7 months (range, 1.6–291.1 months) from the index
procedure; six of these patients (3.2%) ultimately required
a second bushing change. Using revision of the stemmed

54 cases (29.0%). Thirty-two were stemmed component
revisions and 22 involved replacement of the bushings
only, as described previously. Six of 13 patients with local
recurrence were treated with an amputation, and seven
were palliated. Eight of the 13 patients (61.5%) with local
recurrence ultimately died of their disease, and ﬁve of the
13 (38.5%) are alive. Of the ﬁve patients who currently are
alive,
remain disease-free at 50, 141, 166, and
205 months. One patient currently is alive with metastatic
pulmonary disease at 38 months after the index procedure.
Eighteen of the 186 patients (9.7%) ultimately required
amputation after either the index or later revision procedure
and were categorized as having failed limb salvage efforts.
The reason for amputation was infection in nine patients,
local recurrence in six, positive surgical margins in two,
and metastasis to the pelvis in one.

Fig. 8A–D The common modes of mechanical failure seen in this
series of cemented rotating-hinge distal femoral endoprostheses from
1980 to 2008 are shown. (A) A radiograph shows aseptic loosening of
a custom-casted femoral stem 24 years after the index reconstruction.
The absence of extramedullary porous coating on the proximal body
is evident. In our series, there were 22 total instances of aseptic
loosening: 19 custom and three modular. (B) Fatigue fractures of a
custom-casted femoral stem (right) and femoral body (left) are

illustrated. There was only one fatigue fracture of a modular
component, which was a casted (not forged) Morse taper segment.
In our series, there were 10 total fatigue fractures: nine custom and
one modular. (C) An axial photograph shows a fractured hollow,
custom-casted femoral body. (D) In our series, there were 22 failures
of the rotating-hinge bushings, as illustrated in this photograph, 15
custom and seven modular.

Modular versus Custom Distal Femoral Implants

reconstruction after distal femoral resection. Although high
long-term implant survival and functional scores have been
reported with a wide variety of reconstructive methods [5,
7, 14, 44, 53–55, 57, 65], our experience with osteoartic-
ular allografts between 1975 and 1979 was poor, and in
1980 we abandoned this method of reconstruction in favor
of a cemented endoprosthetic technique [13, 14, 51].
Recently, critics of this technique have cited high rates of
aseptic loosening as the major reason for using alternative
ﬁxation methods [2, 38]. Such criticism does not consider
the potential improvement in cemented implant survival
over historical rates attributable to design modiﬁcations.
We asked the following four questions: (1) Do newer
implant designs perform better than older custom-designed
implants? (2) Does tumor diagnosis inﬂuence implant
survival? (3) What is the typical long-term functional result
after distal femoral replacement? (4) What are the com-
plications associated with endoprosthetic reconstruction of
the distal femur?

The major limitations of this study are its retrospective
design, the lack of a control group, and the lack of a pre-
study power analysis. The ﬁrst two limitations are difﬁcult
to overcome for numerous reasons. First, musculoskeletal
tumors are rare, and although a prospective design certainly
would enhance the validity of our conclusions, it would be
exceedingly difﬁcult to amass a large series of patients
prospectively. Second, comparison to a control group is
virtually impossible because other methods of reconstruc-
tion were used only rarely at our institution. In the absence
of a prestudy power analysis, we have limited our con-
clusions to address the differences in survival rates and
refrained from drawing conclusions when no difference
was seen in the data. The questions addressed at the start of
this paper will be addressed in light of these few but
important limitations.

Largely owing to the low incidence of musculoskeletal
sarcomas, few studies document the long-term durability of
contemporary cemented distal
femoral endoprostheses
(Table 3). Published implant survival rates vary from
46.3% to 93.0%, potentially a reﬂection of heterogeneous
patient and implant study populations. When compared
with primary total joint implants, the modiﬁcations made to
cemented endoprosthetic designs have been relatively few.
These modiﬁcations include the addition of extramedullary
porous coating, the development of modular segments, and
the use of forged metals that have the potential to reduce
the incidence of fatigue fracture [8, 28, 45, 62]. The evo-
lution of the implants used at our institution reﬂects this
general development of endoprosthetic design (Table 4).
The data presented here suggest the use of contemporary
modular components improve the durability and longevity
of the cemented prosthesis when used in distal femoral
applications. Although custom-casted stems can last two to

three decades, modular designs maintain the intrinsic
beneﬁt of immediate availability and the ability to intra-
operatively tailor components based on the resection level.
Malo et al. [44] reported modular implants were associated
with an improved MSTS functional score among 56
patients. Numerous authors [8, 43, 48, 70] have similarly
reported modular endoprostheses survive longer than his-
torical custom-designed implants. In our series, the mean
time to revision of the four failures among modular
implants was 12.5 months (range, 1.6–21.4 months), indi-
cating these failures were possibly the result of technical
error rather than implant design (Fig. 9). Three of four
modular failures were attributable to aseptic loosening,
likely the result of poor cement technique as noted previ-
ously. The fourth failure of a modular
implant was
attributable to fatigue fracture of a casted, not forged,
Morse taper segment, emphasizing the importance of this
particular design feature. The revision implants for the
three cases of aseptic loosening have outlasted the original
primary reconstructions. Currently, the mean time from
revision surgery for these patients is 138.6 months (range,
107.4–181.2 months). All four patients who underwent
revision of a modular implant still maintain successful limb
salvage. Although an improvement in survival was seen in
this series, we recognize the need for novel implant designs
in special circumstances, such as short residual periartic-
ular segments, which we have dealt with by designing a
custom implant with cross-stem pin ﬁxation [6]. A com-
pressive intramedullary device based on Wolff’s law
(Compress1; Biomet Inc, Warsaw, IN) was developed to
improve ﬁxation in such situations and to reduce the need
for custom-designed cemented implants. Five- to 10-year
reports of implant survivorship after the use of this device
have been promising [2, 38].

By stratifying patients according to disease grade and/
or stage, we found a comparison of implant to patient
survival provides a useful measure of disease-speciﬁc
implant efﬁcacy (Fig. 10). Patients with low-grade tumors
have a normal life expectancy and thus should expect to
outlive their prostheses. As a result, this group almost
certainly will require at least one revision procedure in
their lifetime. However, none of the patients with dis-
seminated, Stage III disease outlived their prosthesis in
this series. For patients with high-grade localized disease
(Stage IIA/IIB), overall prosthesis survivorship remained
greater than patient survival up to a critical time, at which
point the rate of prosthetic failure became greater than
patient survival. The rate of modular implant survival,
however, continued to exceed patient survival with high-
grade localized disease to 15 years. As long-term survival
of patients with high-grade disease approaches 70% to
80% [39–41, 46, 52, 66, 67], the improved longevity of
modular implants seen in this series supports the notion

caring for patients with wound-related issues after endo-
prosthetic replacement [18]. Local recurrence portended a
poor prognosis in this series as 61.5% of patients had died
by the time of the most recent followup.

Our study reports the improved survival of cemented
distal femoral endoprostheses during the past three de-
cades. Contemporary modular forged implants performed
better than the custom-designed prostheses of the 1970s
and 1980s. Although failures may occur, mechanical
complications can be revised and potentially outlast the
original reconstruction. We recognize revision procedures
will be necessary for patients with long-term life expec-
tancy, and the need for continued improvement
in
reconstruction techniques and implant design, as high-
grade disease-speciﬁc survival
rates may continue to
improve.

that a cemented endoprosthesis will continue to provide a
durable method of reconstruction.

The functional scores were high for the majority of
patients who underwent endoprosthetic distal
femoral
reconstructions (Table 3). Functional scores are assigned
subjectively, and although newer scoring systems have
attempted to eliminate subjective terminology, a precise
and accurate measurement of function remains elusive.
Despite these limitations, however, our results conﬁrm the
ﬁndings of previous studies,
favorable long-term
function is possible after cemented distal femoral endo-
prosthetic reconstructions.

The most common local complications in our patients
included mechanical failure, tumor recurrence, and infec-
tion. All 54 cases of mechanical failure (including modular
and custom implants) were salvaged with revision to a
larger stem, cross-stem ﬁxation, or new components.
Similar to ﬁndings described elsewhere, mechanical fail-
ures of this nature did not seem to compromise the overall
limb salvage effort [59, 68]. Infection, however, worsened
the prognosis. Five of 19 patients with wound-related
complications that occurred after the index procedure
required an amputation, and among an additional six
patients who had a deep infection after a second or third
procedure, four required an amputation. The total ampu-
tation rate in this series for all wound-related complications
after either the index or revision procedure was nine of 25
(36.0%). We previously reported our preferred method of
