ABSTRACT 

 
This  work  is  motivated  by  possible  medical  applications  of  focused  ultrasound  in  minimally  invasive 
treatment  of  a  variety  of  disorders.  The  mechanical  and  thermal  effects  caused  by  high-frequency 
ultrasound in different material systems are calculated using a finite element based program called PZflex.  
The pressure distributions generated by plane as well as focused ultrasound beams are presented.  For the 
focused beam, the temperature distribution in the focal zone is also calculated.  The results indicate that the 
heating efficiency of the ultrasound energy in the focal region depends on the exciting frequency and the 
geometry of the focal zone depends on the material being tested. At higher excitation energies, cavitation 
and nonlinear effects need to be included in the simulations.  These effects are under current investigation.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The  interaction  between  ultrasound  and  biological  matters  has  been  investigated  by  a  number  of 
authors  for  almost  half  a  century[1-8].    However,  the  widespread  use  of  therapeutic  ultrasound  in  clinical 
environments has so far been limited, in part, due to incomplete understanding of the interaction process.  
In  order  to  treat  a  narrow  target  area  with  minimal  damage  to  the  surrounding  tissue,  it  is  necessary  to 
predict the path of the ultrasound beam from the transducer to the target.  Since experimental studies using 
living  tissue  is  difficult  and  costly,  theoretical  simulation  of  the  problem  can  be  extremely  useful  in 
providing  a  firm  scientific  basis  for  future  clinical  applications  of  focused  ultrasound.    Furthermore,  the 
complex geometry and acoustic properties of human tissue often preclude their treatment using analytical 
methods  and  numerical  methods  (e.g.,  finite  element  or  FEM)  are  needed  in  order  to  obtain  quantitative 
information on the interaction between ultrasound and biological materials. 

In  this  study,  PZFlex[5],  a  commercially  available  finite  element  based  software,  is  used  to  obtain 
numerical solution of a variety of models of the interaction problem.  PZFlex is widely used for designing 
transducers  [6],  calculating  the  mechanical  effects  of  the  ultrasound  on  tissues  [7],  modeling  therapeutic 
ultrasound  [8] and calculating thermal effects of high-frequency ultrasound  [9]. For this reason, PZFlex has 
recently emerged as a very useful tool in analyzing the mechanical, thermal, biological and clinical aspects 
of therapeutic ultrasound. 

In  this  paper,  the  mechanical  and  thermal  effects  caused  by  high-frequency  ultrasound  in  different 
material  systems  are  calculated.    The  pressure  and  temperature  distributions  generated  by  a  focused 
ultrasound in the material systems are calculated and presented.  Finally, the direction of future research is 
discussed. 

 

 

2. PLANE WAVES  

In most applications of ultrasound, the objective is to treat a small area in the path of the ultrasonic 
beam.  Thus,  the  theoretical  simulations  must  be  able  to  isolate  the  local  effects  associated  with  the 
interaction  process  from  boundary  and  other  effects.  However,  conventional  Finite  Element  Methods

require  the  models  to  have  finite  dimensions  with  specified  conditions  at  the  boundary.  In  dealing  with 
wave local interaction effects with small geometric and material features in extended media, many modern 
FEM  packages  use  boundary  conditions  that  approximately  simulate  the  radiated  energy  out  of  the  FEM 
model. Two such conditions, namely, symmetry (SYMM) and absorption (ABSR) are used in simulating 
propagation in unbounded media. In order to verify the accuracy of these approximations, the problem of 
plane  waves  propagating  across  a  solid  layer  between  two  different  fluid  media  is  considered.    The 
analytical  solution  of  this  problem  is  compared  with  that  obtained  from  PZflex  in  an  effort  to  insure  the 
accuracy of the FEM code for unbounded media. 
 
2.1 Problem description 

The  three-layered  materials  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.    It  is  infinite  in  the  vertical,  y-direction  and 
semi-infinite along the positive x direction.  The thickness of the water layer is h1 and that of the solid layer 
is h2. A uniformly distributed pressure, f(t), is applied at y = 0.

2.2.  Theoretical solution 

The pressure field within the medium can be calculated by using a standard theoretical approach.   We 
first  solve  the propagation problem  in  the  frequency  domain  and  invert the  resulting  spectral response  to 
obtain the time domain result.  In the frequency domain, the displacement in water can be expressed in the 
form 
      W x
1( ,
where the time dependence, eiωt, has been suppressed. In (1), k1 = ω/α, is the wave number, ω is the angular 
frequency,  α1  is  the  velocity  of  the  acoustic  waves  in  water  and  R  is  the  reflection  coefficient.  The 
displacements in the 2nd and 3rd layers are of the form

2.3 FEM analysis using PZflex 

The FEM calculations using PZflex are carried out in a model with finite dimensions: - 15 mm < y < 
15 mm, 0 < x < 35 mm. The SYMM boundary is used on both sides of this strip, y = ± 15 mm, and the 
ABSR boundary condition is used at x = 35 mm to simulate the infinite dimension along the x direction.   
The  pressure  history  at  x  =  5  mm  in  the  fluid  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.  Comparing  the  results  obtained  by 
theoretical  method  and  FEM,  we  can  see  that  the  theoretical  solution  and  numerical  solution  are  almost 
identical.  However, the small oscillation after the main pulse is caused by numerical noise generated by the 
FEM code.   

As  an  example  of  the  additional  capabilities  of  the  PZflex  software,  the  full-field  pressure  at  two 
different times, calculated from PZflex, are shown in Fig. 4.   The interaction of the waves with the two 
interfaces can be easily identified.

3. FOCUSED ULTRASOUND 

It is well known that a focused lens can steer the beam into a point at higher energy than a uniform 
beam  [8]. The mechanical effect of ultrasound in a material by a uniform load and a phase-delayed source 
that  simulates  focused  ultrasound  is  calculated  and  compared  by  using  PZFlex  FEM  analysis.    In  this 
section, the focused ultrasound is used and the mechanical effect is considered for three cases. 

3.1 Focused wave in a two-layered medium 

In the problem shown in Fig. 5, the pressure caused by a focused cylindrical lens is calculated. The 
materials used are water and aluminum; their mechanical properties are listed in Table 1. In Fig. 5, the part 
above the black line is water and the rest is aluminum.  The angle of the lens is 60o and its radius is 30 mm. 

The focal point of the lens is marked by the symbol “+” in the figure. The thickness of the water layer is 8 
mm and the dimension of the FEM model is 60 mm × 60 mm. All of the boundaries are ABSR boundaries.  
The applied pressure on the lens is the first half of the pulse given in equation (9). 

  The calculated wavefields are shown in Fig. 6. The “focal points” for the two cases: (a) water and 
aluminum, and (b) water only, are also shown. The input energy is the same but the pressure in the “focal 
point” is different for the two cases.  The focal pressure in water is higher than that in aluminum; this is 
expected to be true for most solids including bones and other biological materials. Phase delay and other 
similar techniques can be used to increase the pressure in the solid.

Fig. 6: The wavefields and “focal points” 

      It  should  be  mentioned  that  the  PZflex  calculations  presented  in  Fig.  6  produce  significant  “negative 
pressure”  fields  originating  from  the  edges  of  the  lens.   Since  the  incident  field  in  this  case  is  a  positive 
pressure pulse, the negative pressure field appears to be numerical noise associated with the FEM code. 
 
3.3 Wave interaction with a biomaterial 

In  this  section,  we  consider  the  interaction  of  the  focused  beam  from  the  lens  considered  in  the 
preceding section with a layer of a biomaterial (BIOM) with properties given in Table 1. These properties 
are close to those of human bone tissues. The simulation model is shown in Fig. 7(a), where the black arc is 
the lens, the middle layer is the bone, and the rest is water.  The distance between the edges of the lens and 
the  top  surface  of  the  layer  is  5  mm.  The  result,  presented  in  Fig.  7(b),  shows  that  after  the  ultrasound 
passes through the layer, it is refocused at a point below the layer, as can be predicted on the basis of ray 
theory.

4. THE THERMAL FIELD 

       

 

 

The thermal effects play the most significant role in many applications of therapeutic ultrasound. In 
this  section,  the  quantitative  features  of  the  mechanical  and  thermal  effects  produced  in  a  biomaterial 
insonified by a focused ultrasonic field (Fig. 8), is examined in this section.  For simplicity, both materials 
are assumed to be semi-infinite. The biomaterial is assumed to be dissipative (viscoelastic) with loss factor, 
D,  shown  in  Fig.  9  in  units  of  db/m.  The  effects  of  dissipation  on  the  acoustic  wavefield  can  be 
incorporated in the calculations through the introduction of the non-dimensional specific attenuation factor, 
Q, related to D through the equation 

where  f  is  the  frequency  in  MHz  and  c  is  the  phase  velocity  in  m/s.  The  attenuation  factor,  Q,  for  the 
biomaterial is shown in Fig. 10. It is interesting to note that Q is approximately the same for dilatational 
and shear waves.   

The temperature field produced in the material is governed by the modified heat equation, 

Q

where k is the thermal conductivity and Qu is the dissipated (or absorbed) acoustic energy.  Pzflex tracks 
the  damping  losses  in  the  mechanical field  and  solves  the  discretized  form  of  the heat  equation using  an 
implicit time integrator.  

The thermal properties of the materials used in the calculations are given in Table 2.  The lens is as the 
same  as  the  one  in  last  problem;  its  radius  is  30  mm  and  the  angle  is  60 .    The  dimensions of  the finite 
element model are 60 mm × 60 mm. The incident ultrasound is a continuous pressure wave with frequency 
f, and amplitude 1MPa.

The temperature distributions caused by the focused ultrasound at three different frequencies, .5MHz, 
1MHz, and 1.5 MHz are shown in Figs. 12. It can be seen that the temperature distributions in the three 
cases  are  qualitatively  similar,  but  the  peak  temperatures  in  the  focal  region  are  strongly  frequency 
dependent.  This is shown in Fig. 13 where the calculated peak temperature produced in the focal region of 
the biomaterial is plotted as a function of the exciting frequency.  It can be seen that the peak temperature 
in the focal region first increases then drops rapidly with frequency. At higher frequencies, the increase in 
temperature appears to occur primarily near the interface. The temperature increase in the focal region is 
plotted as a function of time in Fig. 13b. It can be seen that the increase is almost linear in time.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 

 

Locating  the  focal  region  of  therapeutic  ultrasound  in  complex  biological  materials  systems  is  an 
important issue that needs to be properly addressed before wider clinical applications are possible. Lack of 
adequate  knowledge  on  the  temperature  distribution  in  the  biomaterial  can  lead  to  thermal  exposure  to  a 
larger  area  for  longer  period  of  time  and  use  of  higher  intensity  ultrasound  than  may  be  needed.  The 
knowledge  gathered  not  only  can  reduce  the  needed  intensity  of  the  input  ultrasound,  but  also  reduce 
possible  damage  to  the  surrounding  tissues.    The  characteristics  of  the  interaction  between  focused 
ultrasound  and  a  simple  model  of  the  biological  material  have  been  determined  in  this  paper.  Several 
interesting features of the interaction including the shape and size of the focal region and the frequency as 
well  as  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  temperature  field  in  the  material  have  been  presented.      Interaction 
with  realistic  models  of  biological  materials  systems  and  the  effects  of  cavitation,  bubble  formation, 
nonlinear effects, etc. are under current investigation.
