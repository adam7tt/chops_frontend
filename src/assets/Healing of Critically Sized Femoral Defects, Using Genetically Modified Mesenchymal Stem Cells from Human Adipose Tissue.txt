TISSUE ENGINEERINGVolume 11, Number 1/2, 2005©Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Healing of Critically Sized Femoral Defects, Using Genetically Modified Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Human Adipose TissueBRETT PETERSON, M.D.,1JEFFREY ZHANG, D.D.S., Ph.D.,1ROBERTO IGLESIAS, M.D.,1MICHAEL KABO, Ph.D.,1MARC HEDRICK, M.D.,2PROSPER BENHAIM, M.D.,1,2and JAY R. LIEBERMAN, M.D.1ABSTRACTThe FDA has approved the clinical use of recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). How-ever, the use of recombinant BMPs in humans has required large doses of the proteins to be effec-tive, which suggests that the delivery method of bone morphogenetic proteins needs to be optimized.Gene therapy is an alternative method to deliver such recombinant proteins, and gene transfer tech-niques have been tested on a variety of cell types including bone marrow cells, skin fibroblasts, pe-ripheral blood monocytes, and muscle-derived cells. In this study, we sought to determine the abil-ity of BMP-2-producing human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to heal a critically sizedfemoral defect in a nude rat model. After approval by the human subjects protection committee,human adipose tissue was obtained from healthy donors. The lipoaspirate was processed as previ-ously described (De Ugarte, D.A., et al. Cells Tissues Organs 174, 101, 2003). Cells were grown inculture and infected with a BMP-2-carrying adenovirus. Five million cells were applied to a colla-gen–ceramic carrier and implanted into femoral defects as previously described (Zuk, P.A., et al.Mol. Biol. 13, 4279, 2002). All animals were killed at 8 weeks. Femora were dissected out and un-derwent radiographic, histologic, and biomechanical analysis. Eleven of the 12 femora in the grouptreated with human processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cells genetically modified to overexpress BMP-2 had healed at 8 weeks. This was assessed by radiographs, by mechanical testing, and by his-tology. The one femur that did not heal had a subacute infection. All eight of the femora treatedwith the rhBMP-2-impregnated collagen–ceramic carrier healed. No statistically significant differ-ence was detected between these two groups. Evaluation of the control groups: group II (colla-gen–ceramic carrier with HPLA cells) and group III (collagen–ceramic carrier alone) showed thatnone of the femora had healed by 8 weeks. Our results indicate that HPLA cells genetically modi-fied by adenoviral gene transfer to overexpress BMP-2 can induce bone formation in vivoand heala critically sized femoral defect in an athymic rat. The HPLA cells alone did not induce significantbone formation. However, when combined with an osteoinductive factor these cells may be an ef-fective method for enhancing bone healing and the tissue engineering of bone.1UCLA Department of Orthopedic Surgery, and 2UCLA Department of Plastic Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine atUCLA, Los Angeles, California.120INTRODUCTIONMESENCHYMALSTEMCELLShave been detected in hu-man adipose tissue.1These adipose-derived mes-enchymal stem cells have the potential to differentiateinto bone, cartilage, or muscle when grown in the ap-propriate tissue culture medium.2,3Interestingly, thesecells are relatively easy to expand in culture and exhibitlow rates of senescence even after 15 or more passages.4,5The potential to harvest stem cells from adipose tissue isparticularly promising because adipose tissue is in abun-dant supply and can be harvested with minimal morbid-ity via liposuction. Here we report that human adiposetissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells can be geneticallymodified to overexpress bone morphogenetic protein 2(BMP-2) and to induce healing of critically sized femoraldefects in athymic rats.The tissue engineering of bone requires a combinationof osteoinductive factors, osteoprogenitor cells, a matrixto serve as a scaffold for cells, and an adequate bloodsupply. Seminal experiments by Urist and co-workersdemonstrated that bone contained osteoinductive mole-cules, which Urist termed bone morphogenetic proteins(BMPs).6,7The osteoinductive potential of recombinantBMPs has been demonstrated in animal models8–12aswell as in clinical studies.13–15The Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) approved the use of recombinant hu-man BMP-2 for spine fusion and granted a humanitariandevice exemption for the use of BMP-7 (OP-1) to treatrecalcitrant nonunions. However, the results of clinicaltrials have been somewhat disappointing, especially be-cause the use of recombinant BMPs in humans requireslarge doses of the protein to be effective.15–17These re-sults suggest that the collagen carriers presently beingused are not the most efficient protein delivery vehicles.Furthermore, although the high doses of recombinantBMPs induce bone formation, these recombinant proteinsare expensive, and there are concerns about potentialoncogenic effects, especially if redosing is necessary.Clearly, the delivery of these recombinant proteins needsto be optimized.Concurrent with the work on osteoinductive mole-cules, some investigators have pursued what are termed“cell-based” strategies to induce bone formation. Thiswork has focused on the delivery of osteoprogenitor cellsrather than osteoinductive molecules. In a variety of an-imal models, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stemcells, administered with an appropriate carrier, have dem-onstrated the ability to heal critically sized bone de-fects.18–21Even in large animal models such as a caninefemoral defect model, Bruder and Fox were able to dem-onstrated that autologous mesenchymal stem cells couldinduce healing of defects that otherwise progressed tononunions.21The use of autologous mesenchymal stemcells to treat bone defects is appealing from a safetyHEALING OF CRITICALLY SIZED FEMORAL DEFECTS121standpoint and also because bone defects frequently oc-cur in locations where there is a paucity of osteoprogen-itor cells. However, these autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have not yet been dem-onstrated to be effective in patients, and many cliniciansand investigators theorize that both an osteoinductive sig-nal and osteoprogenitor cells may be needed to heal largebone defects or bone defects associated with a compro-mised vascular supply.Genetic enhancement of mesenchymal stem cells couldpotentially increase their osteoinductive ability. Ex vivogene therapy is a strategy to deliver both osteoprogeni-tor cells and an osteoinductive factor to a specific ana-tomic site. In ex vivogene therapy, cells are harvested,processed, and expanded in culture. In culture, the cellscan be genetically modified to overexpress an osteoin-ductive signal such as one of the BMP molecules. Themodified cells can be loaded onto an osteoconductivescaffold and then implanted at a bone defect site.One potential advantage of ex vivogene therapy strate-gies over in vivostrategies is that the cell type to be usedas the delivery vehicle can be selected and expanded inculture. Most work with mesenchymal stem cells hasbeen done with bone marrow-derived cells,20,22,23but in-vestigators have demonstrated that muscle, skin, and evenfat may have potential.24–27In our laboratory, we havesuccessfully used BMP-2-producing bone marrow-de-rived cells via adenoviral gene transfer to heal critical-sized bone defects and to induce spinal fusion in rodentmodels.28,29Other investigators have demonstrated thatgenetically modified muscle-derived cells can inducebone formation and also become incorporated in the newbone that is formed.24,25,30,31Zuk et al. have demonstrated that adipose tissue con-tains a population of cells that show multimesenchymallineage potential in vitro.2Given the appropriate medium,these cells have the ability to differentiate into an os-teoblastic lineage. In addition, these cells can be easilyexpanded in culture and infected with adenoviral vectors,and in contrast to bone marrow-derived mesenchymalstem cells, the number of mesenchymal stem cells in fatdoes not seem to decline with age.3This makes adiposetissue an attractive source of mesenchymal stem cells.Another advantage of using mesenchymal stem cells suchas those derived from adipose tissue is that both paracrineand autocrine responses can be elicited.32–34The trans-duced adipose-derived stem cells not only secrete BMPbut also can respond to the BMP themselves, thus am-plifying the body’s biologic response to this therapy. Inaddition, the endogenously secreted BMP-2 from genet-ically modified cells may have greater biological activ-ity because of appropriate posttranslational modifica-tions.35Finally, depending on the vector chosen, ex vivogene therapy may allow either brief or more sustainedproduction of the osteoinductive protein.We have previously demonstrated that adipose-derivedmesenchymal stem cells transduced with a BMP-2-car-rying adenovirus can induce bone formation when im-planted in a hindlimb muscle pouch in severely compro-mised immunodeficient (SCID) mice.26The purpose ofthis study was to assess the efficacy of BMP-2-produc-ing human adipose-derived stem cells to heal criticallysized femoral defects in nude rats. This study would pro-vide the proof of concept that these cells could be usedto enhance bone repair in humans.MATERIALS AND METHODSAdenoviral vectorThe complementary DNA (cDNA) for hBMP-2 (Ge-netics Institute, Cambridge, MA) was introduced into anadenoviral vector as previously described.29This adeno-viral vector, AdBMP-2, was used to transduce human adi-pose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.Culture of human adipose tissue-derivedmesenchymal stem cellsBy an internal review board-approved protocol, humanadipose tissue was obtained from healthy donors who hadundergone liposuction. All of the donors were between30 and 50 years of age. The lipoaspirate was washed withphosphate-buffered saline, and digested with collagenaseas previously described.1,2Enzyme activity was neutral-ized with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)containing 10% fetal bovine cells (FBS). Cells were fur-ther processed, filtered, and plated. All cells were grownin DMEM plus 10% FBS and maintained at 37°C and5% CO2. Cells were expanded in culture through threeto five passages before infection with the BMP-2-carry-ing adenovirus.Adenoviral infectionWhen the adherent cells were nearly confluent, 5 mil-lion human-derived processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cellswere infected with the BMP-2-carrying adenovirus at amultiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Cells were keptin culture overnight after infection. The next day, the su-pernatant of the infected cells was removed and assayedfor BMP-2 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis.36The cellswere then trypsinized, washed, centrifuged, and counted.Five million infected cells were then concentrated into avolume of approximately 100 !l and applied to the col-lagen–ceramic carrier in an Eppendorf tube.Collagen–ceramic carrierA collagen–ceramic carrier (compression-resistant ma-trix, calcium phosphate ceramic plus type I bovine colla-PETERSON ET AL.122gen; Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN) was usedto deliver cells to the femoral defect. The carrier was cutwith a scalpel into a 5!5!7 mm block and placed intoa sterile Eppendorf tube. Transduced, adipose-derivedstem cells were then loaded onto the carrier and allowedto soak in for approximately 5 min. All of the femoral de-fects received the collagen–ceramic carrier.In vivobone formation at an orthotopic siteApproval was obtained from the Institutional AnimalReview Committee before beginning any animal studies.Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalational anes-thetic and monitored by an assistant during surgery. At sur-gery, a polyethylene plate was secured to the femur of ananesthetized rat, using Kirschner wires and cerclage wiresas previously described.29A 6-mm critically sized femoraldefect was created in the rat hindlimb, using a high-speedburr. Once the defects were created, a collagen–ceramiccarrier impregnated with either normal saline, 20 !g of re-combinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2), 5 million human-derived processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cells, or 5 millionAdBMP-2-transduced HPLA cells were implanted in thedefect site. The defects were then covered with a musclepouch and the skin was closed with Vicryl. All rats wereable to bear their full weight after surgery.Study groupsThirty-two nude rats were placed into one of four treat-ment groups. In group I, 12 rat femoral defects were im-planted with collagen–ceramic carrier containing 5 millionAdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells. In group II, six rat femoraldefects were implanted with collagen–ceramic carrier con-taining 5 million uninfected HPLA cells. In group III, sixrat femoral defects were implanted with collagen–ceramiccarrier alone. In group IV, eight rat femoral defects wereimplanted with collagen–ceramic carrier containing 20 !gof rhBMP-2. Radiographs were taken 4 and 8 weeks aftersurgery. All animals were killed at 8 weeks. All femorawere explanted, palpated to assess healing, and underwenthistologic or biomechanical analysis (Table 1).Radiographic reviewAnimals were anesthetized and radiographs were madeat 4 weeks and at 8 weeks. The collagen–ceramic carrierwas radioopaque, making it difficult to distinguish orquantify new bone formation at 4 weeks. At the 8-weektime point, each radiograph was examined by threeblinded independent observers and given a score de-pending on the amount of bone that had formed. Femorawere evaluated for radiographic evidence of healing, us-ing a graded scoring system (0, minimal to no evidenceof new bone formation; 1, evidence of bone formation,complete healing questionable; 2, solid-appearing bone,complete healing). Radiographic scores were summed togive a maximum score of 6. Femora with a cumulativescore of 5 or greater were considered healed. Results ofthe radiographic evaluation were subjected to statisticalanalysis. The Fisher exact test was used to compare theaverage score of each group, and the "statistic was cal-culated to quantify interrater reliability.Histologic techniquesTwenty femora were analyzed histologically (Table 1).These included five femora in group I (AdBMP-2-in-fected HPLA cells), six femora in group II (uninfectedHPLA cells), six femora in group III (collagen–ceramiccarrier alone), and three femora in group IV (20 !g ofrhBMP-2-treated limbs).After sacrifice, femurs were dissected out and fixed in40% ethanol. Specimens were dehydrated, and embed-ded in polymethylmethacrylate. Serial cross-sections,150 !m thick, were cut from the central portion of eachdefect, mounted on plastic slides, milled, and polished,and the surface was stained with toluidine blue. Sagittalsections of the proximal and distal host–defect interfaceswere also prepared.Histomorphometric analysisCross-sections of the femora were also analyzed his-tomorphometrically. After transverse sectioning with adiamond band saw and toluidine blue staining, 10 cross-sections of femora from each of the groups were scannedwith a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. For eachstained cross-section that was scanned, the total cross-sectional area of bone was measured, using the BioquantOsteo system (Bioquant Image Analysis, Nashville, TN).In addition, the total area of bone formation and bonedensity was calculated. For each parameter, a mean wascalculated for the specimens in each group. The meanvalues were subjected to statistical analysis.Mechanical testingAt 8 weeks, all rats were killed and femora were ex-planted. The surrounding soft tissue, pins, and polyacety-lene plates were removed from the femora. The explantedfemora were then assessed manually for healing. Onlyfemora from group I (AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells) andHEALING OF CRITICALLY SIZED FEMORAL DEFECTS123from group IV (rhBMP-2) were found to have healed suf-ficiently to undergo biomechanical testing. Biomechani-cal testing could not be done on femora from either groupII (uninfected HPLA cells) or from group III (colla-gen–ceramic carrier alone) because none of the femorahad sufficient bone formation to be adequately tested. Sixfemora from group I (AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells) andfive femora from group IV (rhBMP-2) underwent bio-mechanical testing. In addition, six femora from age-matched rats in which no defect was created were testedbiomechanically and served as controls. The ends of thebones were mounted in polymethylmethacrylate. Eachspecimen was suspended in a Burstein–Frankel torsiontester and the loading of the specimens was initiated bypendulum impact. The data were recorded in real time ona storage-and-oscilloscope photographer. Specimens weretested until failure. Rotational displacement and torque tofailure were recorded. From these data torsional stiffnessand energy to failure were calculated. For each of thegroups, mean values and confidence intervals for maxi-mum torque, energy to failure, and torsional stiffness werecalculated and were subjected to statistical analysis.Statistical methodsThe radiographic findings on rats at 8 weeks wereassessed with a Fisher exact test. The radiographs werereviewed by three observers, and the "statistic wascalculated as a measure of interobserver reliability.The mean values from the results of the mechanicaltesting were compared among all groups (when possi-ble) by one-way analysis of variance and the post hocStudent–Newman–Keuls test. For the histomorphome-tric analysis, mean total bone area and mean bone density were calculated. Confidence intervals werecalculated as well and differences were assessed byStudent ttest.RESULTSRadiographic analysisEleven of the 12 femora in group I (HPLA cells in-fected with the BMP-2-carrying adenovirus) had healedTABLE1.SUMMARYOFSTUDYGROUPSTotal no.No. studiedNo. studiedNo. of sections studiedGroupof defectsradiographicallyhistologicallyhistomorphometricallyI:AdBMP-2-infected human-derived1212510II:processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cellsII:Uninfected HPLA cells66610III:Collagen–ceramic carrier alone66610IV:rhBMP-2 with carrier88310radiographically at 8 weeks (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The onefemur that did not heal had a subacute infection. All eightof the femora in group IV (rhBMP-2 impregnated colla-gen–ceramic carrier) healed (Fig. 1 and Table 2) No sta-tistically significant difference in radiographic evidenceof healing was detected between femora treated withAdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells or rhBMP-2 was de-tected. Evaluation of the femora in group II (uninfectedHPLA cells) and in control group III (collagen–ceramiccarrier alone) indicated little to no evidence of healingbased on analysis of plain radiographs. No radiographsof femora from rats in these goups appeared to havehealed defects although this was occasionally more dif-ficult to determine because of the radioopaque colla-gen–ceramic carrier (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The "statistic(0.82) revealed excellent agreement among the three ob-servers who reviewed the 8-week radiographs.Histologic analysisHistologic analysis of femora from group I (AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells) showed new bone formation ex-tending the length of the defect (Fig. 2). The ceramic por-tion of the carrier was still identifiable at the 8-week timepoint. New bone formed both around the collagen–ce-ramic carrier and within the interstices of the carrier. Theceramic was incorporated within the new bone thatformed in femoral defects treated with AdBMP-2-in-fected HPLA cells. Examination of the host–defect in-PETERSON ET AL.124terface demonstrated solid bone formation at both endsof the femoral defects (Fig. 3A).Analysis of group II (HPLA cells) and group III (col-lagen–ceramic carrier alone) demonstrated sparse pe-riosteal and endosteal new bone formation at the proxi-mal and distal ends of the defect. The ceramic portion ofthe carrier was still present in the middle of the femoraldefect, but there was little to no new bone formationacross the defect or in the interstices of the osteocon-ductive carrier even at 8 weeks (Fig. 3B and C).Femora of rats in group IV (collagen–ceramic carrierwith rhBMP-2) showed histologic evidence of healingsimilar to that of femora of group I rats. No qualitativedifferences were noted between bone induced by BMP-2-expressing HPLA cells and bone induced by recombi-nant BMP-2.Histomorphometric analysisHistomorphometric analysis was done on toluidineblue-stained cross-sections of femora from each of thegroups. Ten cross-sections from each of the groups werescanned with the CCD camera and the total cross-sec-tional area of bone was measured, using the Bioquant Os-teo system (Bioquant Image Analysis). The mean cross-sectional area of bone in the healed defects of femoratreated with BMP-2-expressing HPLA cells was 4.7"0.4 mm2. This was significantly higher than the meancross-sectional area of bone induced by HPLA cells aloneFIG. 1.(A–D) Radiographs of specimens at the 8-week time point.

The mean cross-sectional area of bonein femora treated with rhBMP-2 (group IV) was 5.2"0.6 mm2. Mean bone area and mean bone density weresimilar between group I (BMP-2-expressing HPLA cells)and group IV (rhBMP-2) (Fig. 4).Biomechanical testingBiomechanical testing was performed to quantitativelyassess the structural properties of the healed femora. Bio-mechanical testing could not be done on any femur fromgroup II (uninfected HPLA cells) or group III (carrieralone) because none had sufficiently healed. After re-moval of the polyacetylene plate, femora from these treat-ment groups were not rigid enough to be tested in theBurstein–Frankel torsion device. Specimens that wererigid enough were tested to failure in torsion. Femora thatwere tested failed just proximal or distal to the healed de-fect site (Fig. 5). At this location, the diameter of thehealed femora was smaller than at the healed defect site.Six femora from group I (AdBMP-2-infected HPLAcells), five femora from group IV (rhBMP-2), and sixage-matched control femora without defects were tested.Specimens were tested in torsion, and energy to failureand torsional stiffness were calculated. Mean values andconfidence intervals were calculated for peak torque, en-ergy to failure, and torsional stiffness. No statistically sig-nificantly differences were detected between goup I,group IV, and the control nonoperated femora with re-HEALING OF CRITICALLY SIZED FEMORAL DEFECTS125spect to average torque to failure, torsional stiffness, orenergy to failure (Table 3). There was a relatively highstandard deviation for each of the group averages. Therewas a trend toward higher stiffness in the nonoperatedfemora, whereas the healed femora from either group I(AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells) or group IV (rhBMP-2)tended to have lower torsional stiffness.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that BMP-2-producing humanadipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a colla-gen–ceramic carrier can heal critically sized femoral de-fects in athymic rats. In contrast, when human adiposetissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were placed in afemoral defect with just collagen–ceramic carrier, criti-cally sized defects did not heal. Bone defects treated withBMP-2-producing adipose-derived mesenchymal stemcells were healed in 11 of 12 animals by 8 weeks aftercell implantation. The one femur that did not heal wasfound to have a subacute infection. Biomechanical test-ing revealed no statistically significant difference in en-ergy to failure, torque to failure, or torsional stiffness be-tween femora treated with BMP-2-producing bonemarrow cells or recombinant BMP-2 and nonoperatedage-matched control femora. We purposely chose a highdose (20 !g) of BMP-2 because it is a more stringentcomparison group with which to assess the quality ofTABLE2.RADIOGRAPHICSCORESAT8 WEEKSTotal no.No. studiedRadiographic scorepValueGroupof defectsradiographicallyat 8 weeks(vs. group III)I:AdBMP-2-infected human-derived12125.4 "0.5#0.02II:processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cellsII:Uninfected HPLA cells660.9 "0.2NSIII:Collagen–ceramic carrier alone660.8 "0.2—IV:rhBMP-2 with carrier885.7 "0.2#0.02FIG. 2.Toluidine blue-stained sagittal section of full-length femur.

These results are promising regardinga future strategy in which AdBMP-2-infected adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells could be adapted to treatbone repair problems such as delayed unions ornonunions in patients.The clinical problems of delayed unions and nonunionPETERSON ET AL.126represent failures in bone repair.37The biology of bonerepair requires an osteoinductive signal, host respondingcells, a matrix, and an adequate vascular supply. In thepast, autogenous bone has been the “gold standard” bonegraft material for the treatment of atrophic nonunions.However, the significant morbidity associated with theharvest of autogenous graft and the limited amount of au-tologous bone available make other options attractive.38,39FIG. 3.Higher power view of toludine blue-stained sagittal sections of host–defect interface.

Some endosteal new bone did form. (C) Group III, carrier alone. Results aresimilar in appearance to group II, with sparse periosteal new bone formation and some endosteal bone formation, but no evi-dence of potential for healing across the defect site. (D) Group IV, rhBMP-2 along with ceramic carrier resulted in bone forma-tion, which formed a continuous cortex with the host cortex. This was similar in appearance to group I. Asterisk marks the cutend of rat femur. Arrow points to bone or carrier present in the defect site.FIG. 4.Histomorphometric analysis of toluidine blue-stained cross-sections of femora from each of the four groups. The bargraphs demonstrate mean bone area for each of the groups. Both AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells (group I) and rhBMP-2 (groupIV) induced significantly more bone than the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between either total bonearea or bone density measurements for femora treated with rhBMP-2 or AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells.Recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins are nowclinically available, but extremely high doses are neces-sary to induce bone in humans,13,14,40suggesting that thedelivery of recombinant bone-inducing proteins needs tobe optimized. There are concerns that a single dose ofexogenous protein will not induce an adequate osteoin-ductive response in patients with poor vascularity, a dam-aged soft tissue envelope, or a history of nicotine or ste-roid use. In these cases, alternative methods of bonegrowth factor delivery, such as regional gene therapy withgenetically manipulated stem cells, may be attractive. Inaddition, alternative viral genetic delivery systems are be-ing developed. One of the most promising of these viraldelivery systems is based on human parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 because of its high trans-duction efficiencies and biosafty ratings. Using Sprague-HEALING OF CRITICALLY SIZED FEMORAL DEFECTS127Dawley rats and a replication-deficient AAV carrying theBMP-2 transgene, Chen et al. demonstrated bone forma-tion after directly injecting the recombinant AAV into rathindlimbs.41Other investigators have had success in reg-ulating BMP-2 expression by recombinant AAV by in-corporating a tetracycline-sensitive promoter.42Althoughno studies have yet shown healing of a critically sizedbone defect, AAV strategies are promising. Clearly genetherapy will not be necessary to treat all bone repair prob-lems, but once safer and more effective vectors can bedeveloped, gene therapy may become one aspect of acomprehensive tissue-engineering strategy.We have previously demonstrated that an ex vivogenetherapy strategy using bone marrow cells transduced witha BMP-2-carrying adenovirus could be used to heal crit-ically sized defects in syngeneic rats.29In our own lab-FIG. 5.Digital photograph of healed femur that had been treated with AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells. This femur was ex-planted and cleaned of soft tissue. The ends of the bone were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, and the specimen was thentested to failure in the Burstein–Frankel torsion device. The healed femoral defect can be seen (arrowhead). In addition, the siteat which failure occurred (arrow) and the PMMA-embedded ends of the bone are visible. This result was typical for femora fromeither group I (AdBMP-2-infected HPLA cells) or group IV (rhBMP-2).TABLE3.BIOMECHANICALTESTINGEnergy to failureTorsional stiffnessPeak torqueGroupResultapValuebResultapValuebResultapValuebI:AdBMP-2-infected human-derived5.7" 3NS0.26" 0.2NS1.7" 1.1NSII:processed lipoaspirate (HPLA) cellsII:Uninfected HPLA cells——————III:Collagen–ceramic carrier alone——————IV:rhBMP-2 with carrier8.6" 2.0NS0.21" 0.1NS1.9" 0.9NSNonoperated femora5.7" 2.2—0.5" 0.3—2.4" 1.0—aData represent mean values and 95% confidence intervals.bVersus nonoperated femora.oratory, rat fibroblasts transduced with the same BMP-2-carrying adenovirus were unable to heal these defects(our unpublished data), suggesting that not only the os-teoinductive protein but also the cellular delivery vehi-cle was critical. Other investigators have used muscle-derived stem cells to heal critically sized defects and haveshown that these transplanted cells directly participate inbone formation.30,31,43,44Lee et al. infected muscle-de-rived mesenchymal stem cells with a BMP-2-carrying ad-enovirus and healed calvarial defects in SCID mice.44Us-ing fluorescence in situhybridization techniques, Lee etal. showed that a small percentage of the muscle-derivedcells that were implanted into the calvarial defects haddifferentiated into osteoblasts in vivo.Compared with other tissue sources for mesenchymalstem cells, human adipose tissue is an attractive sourceof autologous stem cells. In most patients, there is a morethan adequate supply of adipose tissue, and large amountsof it may be safely available by liposuction. Once har-vested, large numbers of mesenchymal stem cells can beobtained from a relatively small amount of fat.4Thesecells are a plentiful, expandable, and attractive source ofstem cells for tissue engineering. In addition, the numberof mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissuedoes not appear to decrease with age.3Theoretically,these stem cells could be harvested from elderly patients.It is also important to note that adipose-derived stemcells were not able to heal a defect if they were not ge-netically manipulated to overexpress BMP-2. It has beenreported that muscle-derived mesenchymal stem cellsalone cannot heal crtically sized defects, either.30In con-trast, it has been shown that mesenchymal stem cells de-rived from bone marrow can heal critically sized bonedefects.18These findings suggest that these cells havevarying degrees of native osteoinductive potential, whichmay have an impact on cell-based therapies. Compara-tive studies are necessary to determine which cellular de-livery vehicles—fat-derived, muscle-derived, or bonemarrow-derived cells—are the most effective for ex vivogene transfer strategies. In addition, in this study, the adi-pose tissue was harvested from relatively young andhealthy patients undergoing liposuction procedures. Fur-ther studies need to be performed with stem cells fromelderly patients to determine whether osteoinductive po-tential is maintained with age.For a gene therapy strategy to be used clinically, it willneed to be efficacious and have a high safety index. Ifthese difficulties can be solved, it will greatly add to theability of clincians to treat bone loss problems. In sim-ple cases allograft or autograft bone will be the most ef-fective treatment, in others a recombinant protein may benecessary, and finally gene therapy-based strategies maybe needed to treat the most difficult problems. Each ofthese therapies will represent one aspect of an overallstrategy for the tissue engineering of bone.PETERSON ET AL.128ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work was supported by a grant from the NIH toJ.R.L.
