Abstract 
The degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) rests on many factors, but some of the main ones are 
the absence of a blood vessel supply, excessive overloading, and cycling loadings. This deterioration 
may contribute to peripheral pain and neurological dysfunctions. When degeneration is severe or in 
some other cases when the annulus fibrosus (AF) ruptures, fusion surgery, disc arthroplasty, and disc 
discectomy have been used as clinical solutions. However, these solutions limit the range of motion, 
the  material  used  does  not  reproduce  the  natural  behavior,  and  more  importantly,  it  weakens  the 
overall  mechanical  response of  the  spinal  column,  which  accelerates  degeneration.  Recent  research 
indicates a new focus on the composite nature of the annulus. In this paper, a mathematical model is 
used  to  predict  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  AF  based  on  its  anatomical  structure.  Previously 
published experimental data of AF are correlated with the mechanistic-based predictions and found to 
be in good agreement. The mathematical model shows that maximum strain occurs at the mid-to-outer 
region, which is consistent with published data from animal models. The results indicate that future 
motion preserving, total disc replacement devices and tissue restoration technology can be effectively 
designed using composite materials for synthetic AF.

1 Introduction 

There has been active interest in the investigation of the mechanical properties of the entire intervertebral disc 
(IVD) as well as each of its constituents, where the key objective is to create a new synthetic replacement in the case of 
severe  degeneration.  Currently,  there  exist  three  main  surgical  intervention  solutions  to  remedy  degenerated  discs, 
which includes fusion of the motion segment, disc arthroplasty, and discectomy[1]-[4]. These treatments are usually 
recommended after other options such as medication, physical therapy, neuromodulation, and intradiscalelectrothermal 
therapy are exhausted [5], [6]. In fusion surgery, the movement of a motion segment is constrained using bone graft 
and  it  may  involve  using  screws,  plates  or  rods  to  fix  the  vertebrae  in  place[1],[5].  Fusion  surgery  is  currently 
considered as the gold standard, however, associated problems such as elongated recuperation time, adjacent segment 
degeneration, and pseudarthrosis have been documented [2]. On the other hand, in disc arthroplasty, the degenerated 
disc  is  completely  removed  and  replaced  by  a  synthetic  structure  that  usually  consists  of  metallic  endplates  and  a 
polymer  cage,  i.e.,  metal-on-polymer  device,  or  a  completely  metal  structure,  i.e.  metal-on-metal  [1],[2],[6].  As  of 
2011,  in  the  United  States,  there  were  only  two  devices  that  were  approved  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration, 
which are InMotion/Charité III from DePuy Spine and ProDisc from Synthes [2],[3]. Although, the devices are similar 
in  structure,  both  are  metal-on-polymer  devices,  they  have  significant  biomechanical  differences[3].  For  instance, 
Charité  devices  allow  anterior-posterior  movement  of  the  rotational  axis,  while  it  is  fixed  in  ProDisc  replacement 
technology[2].

Other  prosthetics  such as nucleus pulpous,  motion preserving,  and  dynamic  stabilization  devices  are currently  under 
different stages of investigation and development [2], [3].Finally in disc discectomy, surgeons remove part of the AF 
due to herniation of the disc. As a result, the annulus gets sealed with synthetic material that does not reproduce the 
natural behavior and increases the risk of disc degeneration [3], [4], [7]. Thus in all, the available replacement discs and 
the  materials  used  to  alleviate  the  disc  degeneration  problem  do  not  reproduce  the  mechanical  and  physiological 
functionality of the natural discs, which make them clinically deficient [3]-[5], [7]-[9]. Thus, it is important to explicate 
the significance of the anatomical structure of natural constituents of the intervertebral disc on the mechanical behavior 
in order to create the “ideal” synthetic IVD. 

Despite the extensive experimental and clinical research published on this topic thus far [1]-[9], the quest for a 
 
biologically-inspired  synthetic  disc  is  impeded  by  the  lack  of  fundamental  understanding  of  the  significance  of  the 
anatomical structure and the contribution of the IVD constituents, i.e. annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP) 
and endplates, to the load-bearing ability and the overall functionality of the disc. This quest is further complicated by 
the  limitations  imposed  by  available  experimental  mechanics  techniques  to  separate  the  mechanical  contribution  of 
each  element.  In  this  paper,  the anatomical  structure of  annulus fibrosus  is  the  focus to  understand  the  load-bearing 
abilities and contribution of the annulus from the perspective of mechanics of composite materials. 

2 Annulus Fibrosus Background 

The  annulus  fibrosus  is  a  biological,  ring-like  structure  that  forms  the  outer  part  of  the  intervertebral  disc, 
where its task is to keep the nucleus pulposus in place while resisting complex loadings from the vertebral bodies and 
the  NP.  The  annulus  fibrosus  is  made  of  approximately  20  lamellae,  where  each  lamella  consists  of  near  40  fiber 
bundles  of  proteoglycan  and  collagen  [8],  [10].  The  proteoglycan  bonds  the  lamellae  structure  together,  while  the 
collagen fibers serve as the load bearing members. Moreover, it was found that the annulus varies from a compliant 
material  near  the  nuclear-annular  region  to  a  stiffer  material  at  the  outside  boundary  of  the  annulus  [11]-[13].  The 
annulus fibrosus has been experimentally investigated as a homogenous isotropic material to determine the mechanical 
properties;  nonetheless  a  few  researchers  have  studied  the  annulus  as  a  heterogeneous  structure  with  anisotropic 
material properties [11]. Generally, these efforts focused either on the contribution of the annulus as part of the entire 
motion  segment  or  only  on  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  extracted  annulus  with  limited  regard  to  the  anatomical 
properties  of  the  annulus  based  on  its  composite  mechanics  properties.  Adams  et  al.  suggested  the  annulus  is  more 
likely to collapse in the posterior region due to damage of the endplate [14]. They reported the posterior section of IVD 
experienced  25%  higher  stresses  after  the  endplate  was  damaged  [14].  Schmidt  et  al.  numerically  simulated  the 
movement  of  the  motion  segment  with  and  without  the  nucleus  pulposus  and  compared  the  results  with  in-vitro 
experiments  [15].  The  in-silico  results  predicted  the  range  of  motion  of  the  in-vitro  studies  with  95%  accuracy; 
however,  the  properties  used  in  the  simulation  were  iterated  to  mimic  the  movement  with  disregard  to  the  actual 
physical and mechanical properties of the intervertebral soft tissue [15]. On the other hand, Krismer et al. indicated that 
the  structure  of  the  annulus  fibrosus  contributes  significantly  to  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  motion  segment  in 
addition  to  dampening  cyclic  loads  [16].  Wagner  et  al.,  on  the  other  hand,  reported  that  the  natural  annulus  is  an 
uneven  material  with  stiffer  response  when  tested  in  tension  (Etension=0.447±0.379MPa)  than  in  unconfined 
compression (Ecompression=0.235±0.127MPa); an indication of dependence of the behavior of the constituents of annulus 
fibrosus  on  the  loading  direction  [17].  Elucidating  the  sensitivity  of  the  response  to  loading  conditions,  Périé  and 
coworkers  measured  the  compressive  modulus  of  the  annulus  fibrosus  of  bovine  tails  using  confined  compression 
stress-relaxation experiments and reported the effective compressive modulus to be 0.74MPa [18]. Alternatively, Fujita 
et al. described the variation in the tensile mechanical properties in the radial direction of AF sections harvested from 
the  anterior  and  posterolateral  quadrants  from  fifteen  human  discs  [19].  The  initial  modulus  showed  a  statistically 
insignificant increase in the inner, middle, and outer region. Meanwhile, the value of the tangent modulus of the middle 
section that consisted of multiple lamellae (0.64±0.46MPa) was statistically different from those reported for the inner 
and  outer  regions,  0.44±0.46MPa  and  0.42±0.45MPa,  respectively  [19].  Anatomically,  Fujita  et  al.  argued  that  the 
dependence of the modulus is attributed to the radial location of each lamella. This argument is mechanically supported 
since the collagen fiber orientation varies between 25° and 45° from the outer to the inner diameters of the annulus, 
respectively  [10]-[12].  Finally,  Holzapfel  et  al.  suggested  that  the  native  annulus  can  be  considered  as  a  composite 
material  [11].  They  harvested  11  human  spines  from  cadavers,  where  single  rectangular  lamellae  specimens  were 
separated based on different regions of the annulus. A tensile load was then applied along the fibers of the lamellae and 

127 

G. Youssef et. al.  

the  tensile  modulus  was  measured.  The  results  confirmed  the  fiber  orientation  of  the  annulus  varies  in  the  radial 
direction  and  the  stiffness  along  the  longitudinal  and  transverse  fiber  direction  change  accordingly.  The  material 
stiffness of the lamella was 78MPa in the longitudinal direction and 0.50MPa in the transverse direction [11]. Notably, 
these results of the elastic moduli of single lamella are significantly different from those reported by Wagner et al. of 
the  effective  modulus;  highlighting  the  significance  of  the  number  of  lamella  and  fiber  orientation  on  the  overall 
response of the annulus material [17]. 

Despite the extensive research on the annulus fibrosus, limited research has been conducted on the validity of 
the  presumption  that  the  annulus  can  be  considered  as  an  engineering  composite  material  and  that  the  fiber  volume 
fraction  and  orientation  are  optimized  to  resist  common  physiologic  loads.  The  assumption  of  applicability  of 
mechanics of composite materials, which will be demonstrated in this paper, can be used to transform the development 
of  prosthesis  design.  This  is  significant  since  researchers,  on  separate  but  not  consistent  bases,  have  identified  the 
heterogeneity and anisotropy of the native annulus. The following section is a brief introduction to the mechanics of 
composites,  which  will  be  used  to  elucidate  the  mechanical  behavior  of  the  nature-optimized  annulus  fibrosus 
structure.  Specifically,  we  will  demonstrate  the  use  of  a  mathematical  model  consisting  of  mechanics  of  composite 
materials to predict the elastic properties and mechanical failure behavior and compare it to experimentally measured 
and reported results.   

3 Composite Mechanics 

In the realm of mechanics of composite material, the mechanical properties in the  12-plane can be determined using 
testing  of  a  single  lamella  in  longitudinal  (1-direction)  and  transverse  (2-direction)  [20].  These  include  the  elastic 
modulus  along  the  fiber  direction  (𝐸1),  the  modulus  in  the  direction  transverse  to  the  fiber  (𝐸2),  the  Poisson’s  ratio 
(𝜈12), and the shear modulus (𝐺12).  Once determined, these properties can be used to calculate the properties in  xy-
plane  that  is  rotated  at  any  arbitrary  angle  (θ)  defined  positive  counterclockwise  from  the  1-direction.  Thus,  the 
mathematical  model  used  in  this  study  consists  of  the  transformation  equations  of  composite  mechanics,  which  are 
listed below.

Ex is the modulus in the x-direction, 𝐸𝑦  is the modulus in the y-direction, 𝐺𝑥𝑦  is the shear modulus in xy-plane, νxy is 
the Poisson’s ratio, and 𝜂𝑠𝑖  and 𝜂𝑖𝑠  (i=x, y and s is a contracted notation corresponding to properties in x-y system of 
coordinates)  are  the  shear  coupling  coefficients  that  define  the  dependency  of  the  resulting  normal  and  shear 
deformations  on  applied  loads  [20].Eqs.  (5)  and  (6)  show  that  normal  and  shear  deformations  are  coupled  at  any 
arbitrary fiber orientations except at 0° and 90°. Such that, an application of a normal stress in either x- or y-direction 
will  result  in  normal  and  shear  strains  and  vice  versa.  These  observations  characterize  orthotropic  materials  when 
loaded along the non-principal directions [20]. 

 
Equation (7) presents the linear constitutive relationship, which can be used in conjunction with Eqs(1)-(6) to 
calculate the strains (𝜀𝑥 , 𝜀𝑦 , 𝛾𝑥𝑦 ) based on a given loading scenario (𝜎𝑥 , 𝜎𝑥 , 𝜏𝑥𝑦 ) [22]. The non-principal strains can then 
be  used  to  resolve  the  strains  in  the  lamella  principal  directions  (i.e.,  second  part  of  Eq.  (7)).  Thus,  these  equations 
collectively can be used to understand the reason that the fiber orientations range between 25° and 45° from the outer 
to  the  inner  lamellae  in  alternating  plus-and-minus  configurations.  It  can  also  be  used  to  predict  the  mechanical 
behavior  of  each  lamella  in  the  annulus  fibrosus  under  application  of  different  levels  of  physiologic  loads  that  are 
encountered. The applicability of these equations is shown in the next section with focus on time-independent behavior 
of the annulus fibrosus.

The aforementioned mathematical model was applied using the material properties of single lamellae reported 
by  Iatridisand  coworkers  [21],  [22].  They  collected  the  properties  based  on  an  uniaxial  tension  experiment,  where 
𝐸1=136MPa, 𝐸2=0.76MPa, 𝐺12=0.30MPa, and 𝜈12=0.30 [21], [22]. These properties were adopted with the focus on 
uncovering the underlying physical significance of the fiber orientation in the native annulus fibrosus. 

 
Figure 2 shows the dependence of the mechanical properties on the fiber orientation based on Eqs. (1)-(6). As a 
result, the moduli in the x- and y-direction (Fig. 2.a), shear moduli in the xy-plane (Fig. 2.b), shear coupling coefficient 
between  normal  stress  and  shear  strain  (Fig.  2.c),  and  shear  coupling  coefficient  between  applied  shear  and  normal 
deformation (Fig. 2.d) were calculated for every possible fiber orientation. 

The  results  in  Fig.  3  show  a  comparison  between  the  predicted  moduli  using  composite  mechanics 
transformation equations (Eqs. (1)–(2)) and a priori results [19], [23]. However, the predicted values were higher than 
the average modulus reported by Iatridis et al., E=0.56 ± 0.21MPa [23].  In addition, Eq. (7) was used to predict the 
strain of the annulus based on two different applied loads, nominal torso weight (Fig. 4.a) and rotation (Fig. 4.b).

4.1 Discussion 

In Fig. 2.a the moduli 𝐸𝑥  and 𝐸𝑦  at θ = 0° assume the values of 𝐸1 and 𝐸2as the x- and y-direction are aligned with the 
1- and 2-direction, respectively. It can also be seen that at θ = 90°, the longitudinal direction of the fibers is aligned 
with the 2-direction, thus 𝐸𝑦  = 𝐸1. Notably, when x- and y-axis are aligned with the principal directions, the stiffness in 
the x-direction is nearly 200 times larger than in y-direction, which implies unrealistic physiological deformation. That 
is,  the  structure  can  resist  deformation  in  the  x-direction  but  it  will  collapse  in  the  y-direction  due  to  the  lack  of 
stiffness. Nonetheless, as mentioned in the previous section, the fiber orientation of the natural disc is bounded between 
25° at the most outer lamella and 45° at inner lamella. With this range in mind, the difference between the moduli is 
less than twofold and the normal deformation resistance in x- and y-direction are comparable.  

The shear modulus, 𝐺𝑥𝑦 , is shown in Fig. 2.b, where the lowest values are reported at 0° and 90°, at which the 
shear  moduli  are  equal  to  the  value  of  𝐺12  of  a  single  lamella.  As  the  fiber  orientation  changes,  the  resistance  to 
shearing  deformation  increases  monotonically  from  1.55 𝐺12  at  25°  to reach  a  maximum  of  2.5  𝐺12  at 45°.  In  other 
words,  the  maximum  shearing  resistance  is  located  at  the  inner  diameter  of  the  disc  to  prevent  lamellae  tearing  or 
delamination due to axial rotation loading while annulus fibrosus is in contact with the gelatinous nucleus pulposus. 
This  can  be  further  discussed  by  considering  the  angle  of  twist  (𝜙) per  unit  applied  torque  (T),  (𝜓 =
),  in  axial

𝐺𝑖𝐽

 with 𝑅𝑖 is the radial location of lamella, 𝐺𝑖 is the fiber orientation dependent 
rotation loading scenario, where 𝜓𝑖 =
3𝑡wheret is the  lamella thickness). 
shear modulus of  ith lamella, and  J is polar moment of inertia (such that  𝐽 = 6𝜋𝑅𝑖
Thus, 𝜓𝑖 is inversely proportional to the shear modulus and to the squared of the radial location of the corresponding 
lamella. This implies that the twisting per unit applied torque at the inner diameter of the annulus is nearly nine times 
higher than the outer lamella. This facilitates the strain transduction from the nucleus to the annulus while preventing 
the excessive deformation of the outer perimeter of the annulus to protect the spinal cord and surrounding nerves and 
tissues as the IVD reacts to common loading conditions.

Finally,  Fig.  2c  and  2d  show  the  shear  coupling  coefficients  between  applied  normal  stress  and  shear  strain 
(𝜂𝑖𝑠 ) as well as between applied shear stress and normal deformation (𝜂𝑠𝑖 ), respectively. The former (Fig. 2c) shows 
maximum coupling at fiber orientation with 0°<θ<25°, which indicate that the natural annulus fibrosus is optimized to 

131 

G. Youssef et. al.  

reduce  the  shear  deformation  due  to  applied  normal  stress  (e.g.,  𝛾𝑥𝑦 = 𝜂𝑦𝑠
common loading scenario as the weight of the torso exerts normal compressive stresses on the annulus. On the other 
hand, the maximum coupling between applied shear stress and resulting normal deformation is reported at 25°<θ<45° 
as shown in Fig. 2d. This coupling is needed to transfer the load to the nucleus and the surrounding ligaments during 
axial  rotation  loading  such  that𝜀𝑦 = 𝜂𝑠𝑦
  where𝜂𝑠𝑦 < 0.  This  means,  the  disc  is  axially  compressed  (𝜀𝑦 < 0) as 
shear stress due to torsion is applied based on axial rotation, which as a result gives a rise to the nucleus’s mechanical 
contribution as a load-bearing member. This is consistent with results reported in the literature [19].

In addition, the predicted elastic moduli in Fig. 3 is higher than the one reported by Iatridis et al. because they 
tested segments of the entire annulus as a homogenous material, i.e. they reported the effective modulus of the entire 
annulus wall-thickness [23]. It is important to note here that it is expected based on mechanics of composite laminates, 
where  the  stiffness  of  the  multi-layer  structure  is  less  than  the  stiffness  of  single  lamella  depending  on  the  fiber 
orientation and stacking sequence. Second, good agreement is shown between the predicted and the moduli reported by 
Fujita et al., where they measured the properties of sections of the annulus at outer, middle and inner locations [23]. To 
this  end,  not  only  the  mechanics  of  composite  materials  is  capable  of  predicting  the  properties  at  an  arbitrary  fiber 
orientation, but, and more importantly, it is also capable of explaining the physical and mechanical significance of the 
specific fiber orientation found in the natural disc. That is, the inner lamellae consist of soft material to  facilitate the 
strain transduction from the expansion of the nucleus pulposus, while the outer lamellae tend to be stiffer [11]-[14]. 
Therefore, the fiber configuration of annulus is built to optimize its functionality.   

 
Subsequently, we utilized the properties that were predicted using the transformation equations (Eqs. (1)-(6)) 
and  the  constitutive  relationship  (Eq.  (7))  to  consider  the  response  of  each  lamella  at  different  orientations  to  two 
specific  and  common  loading  scenarios.  First,  the  mechanical  deformation  based  on  applied  axial  compression, 
𝜎𝑦 = −1𝑀𝑃𝑎, due to the weight of the torso, and lateral compression, 𝜎𝑥 = −1𝑀𝑃𝑎, due to the hydrostatic pressure 
from the nucleus on the annulus is calculated along principal direction using Eq. (7) [24], [25]. The approximation for 
stress due to the weight of the upper torso with 1MPa is considered reasonable based on the average weight of torso 
and  surface  area of the  intervertebral disc  [26]-[28]. Nonetheless, the  variation of  the stress  level  does  not  pose  any 
contradictions in the results presented below since the models used herein are linear, where the increase or decrease in 
the  stress  level  will  result  in  change  in  the  corresponding  strain  level  without  change  in  the  overall  behavior, 
respectively.  In  the  second  loading  scenario,  we  consider  the  application  of  axial  rotation  in  addition  to  the  stated 
normal loads.   

Figure 4.a shows the principal strains (in 1-2 plane) based on axial and lateral compression only, from which 
we generate the following four observations. First, The strain along the fiber direction, 𝜀1, is positive, i.e. loading the 
fibers  in  tension,  while  the  strain  in  the  transverse  direction  is  compressive,  𝜀2 < 0.  Second,  the  magnitude  of  the 
transverse strain, 𝜀2, is nearly four times larger than the longitudinal strains because the fibers are stiffer as it is the 
load-bearing member of the lamella. Third, although there is no applied shear stress, shear strain is generated due to the 
shear coupling coefficient, 𝜂𝑖𝑠 . Fourth, the magnitude of normal and shear strains is decreasing as the fiber orientation 
changes from 25°, where the maximum strains are reported, to 45° where 𝜀1   ≈   𝛾12 ≈ 0. This generally justifies that 
disc  herniation  is  due  to  bulging  of  the  annulus  based  on  the  weakening  of  the  middle  to  outer  lamellae,  where  the 
maximum effective strains occur, in response to displacement of the fiber bundles because of the excessive transverse 
strains.  These  justifications  correlated  with  the  findings  collected  by  Wade  et  al.,  where  it  was  found  that  disc 
herniation initiates at the middle lamellae of the annulus[29].In addition, Fig. 4.a shows that the predicted strains are in 
agreement with the tensile radial failure strains of reported by Fujita et al.[19].  

Figure  4.b  shows  the  predicted  strains  due  to  simultaneous  application  of  normal  and  shear  loadings.  The 
values of the longitudinal strain, i.e. along the fiber, remain insensitive to the application of shear stress due to axial 
rotation  when compared  with the  previous  loading  scenario. There is a  slight  increase in  the  shear strain, where the 
maximum  was  reported  at  25°  in  both  loading  scenarios  but  𝛾12 ≅ 0.5  for  normal  loading  while  𝛾12 ≅ 0.9  for 
combined normal and shear loading. The transverse strain has almost increased by twofold after application of shear 
stress because of the contribution of shear coupling coefficient, 𝜂𝑠𝑖  in addition to the normal strain as shown in Fig. 4.a.

Additionally,  the  two-dimensional  model  presented  herein  must  be  improved  to  better  predict  the  3-dimenional 
motions, nonetheless the promise of representing the annulus as composite of collagen fibers embedded in a compliant 
matrix proved to be reliable in predicting basic research measurements. Ongoing research in our group is exploiting the 
other IVD constituents.

5 Conclusions 

In  conclusion,  the  physical  significance  of  the  fiber  orientation  in  the  annulus  fibrosus  has  been  elucidated  by 
mechanics  of  fiber-reinforced  polymer  matrix  composite  materials,  where  the  transformation  equations  are  used  to 
predict the material properties of a single lamella in the x- and y-direction. It is important to note the aforementioned 
equations  have  been  used  extensively  in  the  aerospace  industry  for  the  design  and  analysis  of  complex  composite 
structures. Here, we recalled these equations in the sense of reverse engineering, where the predicted properties will 
reveal  the  connotations  of  the  natural  annulus  composition.  This  in  turn  can  be  used  to  design  robust  biologically-
inspired  total  disc  displacement  devices.  While  the  model’s  predictions  were  in  good  agreement  with  previously 
reported  data,  there  are  two  important  limitations  that  must  be  noted.  First,  the  model  does  not  account  for  any 
nonlinear  mechanical  behavior  (e.g.,  no  hyper-elasticity),  nor  it  accounts  for  the  time-dependent  behavior 
(viscoelasticity is also absent). Second, the interaction between any adjacent lamellae is not included in the presented 
model. Thus, no conclusions can be made about the inter-lamella stresses. 

In this study, the elastic moduli of a single lamella in x- and y-direction were found to have comparable values 
and it was in good agreement with experimentally reported results in the literature. The shear modulus was found to be 
maximum at 45°, which is required to minimize the shear deformation in the lamella adjacent to the nucleus pulposus. 
Additionally, the failure strains were calculated using orthotropic lamina constitutive relationship in each lamella based 
on the fiber orientation and common loading scenarios. The experimentally reported strain tends to agree with strains 
calculated using composite mechanics. In general, the discrepancy between the calculated and measured results are due 
to the limitation of the experimental techniques used to measure the properties as well as negligence of the effect of 
inter-laminar stresses in the theoretical models. Nonetheless, the outcomes of our research substantiate the necessity for 
the composite nature of the annulus fibrosus material. Finally, composite mechanics show a good explanation for the 
high stress and strain on the lateral side  of the annulus fibrosus, which may be one cause for the high appearance  of 
herniated intervertebral discs on the lateral side. The outcomes of this research can be used to design superior synthetic 
annuls fibrosus than their counterparts in existing total disc replacement technologies.
