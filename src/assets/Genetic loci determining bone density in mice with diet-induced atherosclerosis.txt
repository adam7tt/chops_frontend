Genetic loci determining bone density in mice with diet-
induced atherosclerosis. Physiol Genomics 5: 205–215,
2001.—This study investigates the phenotypic and genetic
relationships among bone-density-related traits and those of
adipose tissue and plasma lipids in mice with diet-induced
atherosclerosis. Sixteen-month-old female F2 progeny of a
C57BL/6J and DBA/2J intercross, which had received an
atherogenic diet for 4 mo, were examined for multiple mea-
sures of femoral bone mass, density, and biomechanical prop-
erties using both computerized tomographic and radio-
graphic methods. In addition, body weight and length,
adipose tissue mass, plasma lipids and insulin, and aortic
fatty lesions were assessed. Bone mass was inversely corre-
lated with extent of atherosclerosis and with a prooxidant
lipid proﬁle and directly correlated with body weight, length,
and, most strongly, adipose tissue mass. Quantitative trait
locus (QTL) analysis, using composite interval mapping
(CIM) and multi-trait analysis, identiﬁed six loci with multi-
trait CIM LOD scores . 5. Three of these coincided with loci
linked with adipose tissue and plasma high-density lipopro-
tein. Application of statistical tests for distinguishing close
linkage vs. pleiotropy supported the presence of a potential
pleiotropic effect of two of the loci on these traits. This study
shows that bone mass in older female mice with atheroscle-
rosis has multiple genetic determinants and provides pheno-
typic and genetic evidence linking the regulation of bone
density with adipose tissue and plasma lipids.

signiﬁcant heritability of peak bone mass at various
skeletal sites (48, 50). In these, estimates of the genetic
contribution to variability have been between 50 and
80%. Physiological and pathological determinants that
may secondarily affect bone mass are prevalent in the
aging population and are oftentimes themselves
strongly inﬂuenced by genetic factors. These include
body size, obesity, and diabetes mellitus (9, 10, 43, 46).
Clinical studies have provided evidence that athero-
sclerosis is also associated with reduced bone density
(3, 19, 54). Data suggest that lipid oxidation, which
plays such a central role in the pathogenesis of athero-
sclerosis, may also promote osteoporosis, thereby link-
ing lipid metabolism and inﬂammation to regulation of
bone density (38–40). Thus complex interrelationships
exist among adipose tissue, lipid metabolism, glucose
and insulin regulation, and inﬂammation, which may
inﬂuence both atherosclerosis and reduction in bone
mass.

The mouse has proved to be a useful model for the
genetic dissection of complex traits. Quantitative trait
locus (QTL) analysis in intercrosses or backcrosses of
selected inbred strains allows survey of the entire
genome for loci containing genes that inﬂuence a par-
ticular trait (26). We have previously used this tech-
nique to identify genetic loci affecting myocardial in-
jury and calciﬁcation, lipid metabolism, and obesity,
among other complex traits in mice fed an atherogenic
diet (17, 27, 32). Inbred mouse strains have been
shown to have signiﬁcant heritable differences in a
variety of bone phenotypes, including bone mass and
susceptibility to osteoporosis (2, 6, 12, 22, 35, 55).
Application of the technique of QTL analysis in mice
for peak bone mass has begun to identify genetic loci
associated with this trait (5, 7, 23, 47, 51).

In the above instances, which are typical of most
QTL analyses, single or several closely related traits
were examined, with studies designed to minimize
potentially complicating variables. In the current
study we explore the use of QTL and other statistical
analyses applied to an F2 intercross population for
examining the phenotypic and potential genetic rela-
tionships among multiple complex traits. Of particular

GENETIC LOCI FOR BONE DENSITY IN MICE

interest is the potential for assessing whether the
presence of pleiotropic genetic loci may account for
phenotypic correlations among traits, by analyzing for
colocalization of QTLs for different traits, and applying
additional statistical tests. Although these analyses
cannot prove the presence of pleiotropy, they can gen-
erate important testable hypotheses as to whether
pleiotropy may be present. We have applied these con-
cepts to the setting described above of determination of
bone density in older animals with hyperlipidemia and
atherosclerosis, using an intercross between strains
C57BL/6J and DBA/2J in which an atherogenic diet
was administered. We report here the phenotypic and
genetic relationships observed among the above meta-
bolic and morphometric parameters, atherosclerotic le-
sion formation, and various measures of bone mass and
density, including biomechanical properties, in mature
(16 mo old) F2 female mice with diet-induced athero-
sclerosis. Advanced statistical analyses are employed
to examine these multiple traits and assess potential
pleiotropic effects of genetic loci identiﬁed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mice. Parental mice were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were housed under
conditions meeting the guidelines of the Association for Ac-
creditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Females of strain
C57BL/6J (B6) were mated with DBA/2J (DBA) males. F1
progeny were then intercrossed to produce F2 intercross
progeny. After weaning at ;21 days, female mice were se-
lected and placed on a diet of rodent chow (Purina 5001)
containing 17.5% protein, 11% fat, 0.8% calcium, and 0.5%
phosphorus. At 12 mo of age, this was switched to an athero-
genic high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for another 16 wk. This
consisted of 75% chow supplemented with 7.5% cocoa butter,
2.5% dextrose, 1.625% each of sucrose and dextrin, 1.25%
cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate, with 0.73% calcium
and 0.68% phosphorus (diet 90221; Harlan Teklad, Madison,
WI). The mice were given free access to food and had a
12:12-h light-dark cycle maintained throughout. Body weight
and length (nose to anus) were determined prior to death. At
death, blood was collected by retro-orbital sampling into
EDTA anticoagulant, spleens were removed for DNA isola-
tion, and fat pads (omental, retroperitoneal, parametrial, and
subcutaneous) were removed and weighed. Hearts and as-
cending aortas were removed and embedded in OCT com-
pound and frozen at 270°C. Carcasses were placed in air-
tight individual bags and frozen at 220°C. Subsequently, the
left femurs were dissected and stripped of soft tissue and
placed directly in 10% buffered formalin. The right femurs
were similarly obtained and were wrapped in gauze soaked
in normal saline, placed in airtight plastic bags, frozen at
270°C, and used for biomechanical analyses.

Femoral bone analyses. Bone mineral mass and indices for
bone mineral density (BMD) were measured radiographically
and by computerized tomography. For the former, all sam-
ples were collectively exposed on a single X-ray ﬁlm using a
Faxitron and subsequently developed under similar condi-
tions. Separate X-rays were obtained for the anterior-poste-
rior (AP) and lateral orientations. The X-rays were digitized
and comparatively analyzed. Image 1/AT image processing
software on a 486 IBM compatible computer and a CCD 72
video camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) with Fujinon
Zoom TV lens were used to digitize the X-rays. Image 1/AT

was used to analyze the brightness and contrast level as well
as the cortical diameter at a ﬁxed axial location of the mouse
femur diaphysis. Indices calculated from the digitized mea-
surements for the AP as well as the lateral views were the
average gray scale (integral GS) for the entire femur and for
cross sections at ﬁxed locations of the diaphysis and inter-
trochanteric regions [radiographic bone mineral content
(BMC-R)]. Each of these was averaged by the total area or
respective bone width (D). This method of normalizing for
variation in bone size yielded the best correlation with com-
puted tomography (CT) determined mineral content (r 5
0.77) and density (r 5 0.71) and is analogous to validated
measures used for metacarpal bone density determination in
human studies (1, 14, 16, 49). Values given are relative
densitometry units. Variation in ﬁlm and radiation exposure
at various points on the ﬁlm was determined to be less than
2%. The coefﬁcients of variation for the primary measure-
ments (integral GS, D) were less than 2%, based on repeated
measures by a single observer on two separately prepared
radiographs. Only results for the indices derived from the AP
views is presented subsequently, as results for lateral views
were strongly correlated with these and in almost all in-
stances yielded results for phenotypic and genotypic analyses
that were comparable.

CT determination of bone density was performed using
electron beam computed tomography (EBCT). This technol-
ogy has been used clinically for the past decade to detect and
quantitate calcium deposits in coronary arteries and was
adapted for determination of BMC in mice femurs. Femurs
obtained as described above were embedded in a semisolid
reusable gel phantom and scanned along with calibration bar
phantoms containing known quantities of calcium hydroxy-
apatite in an Evolution EBCT scanner (Siemens Medical
Systems, Iselin, NJ). Bones were oriented perpendicular to
the scanning plane, and a total of 40 axial slices were ob-
tained to image the entire phantom. Imaging employed a
1.5-mm collimation continuous volume scan mode, and im-
ages were reconstructed using vendor supplied sharp recon-
struction kernel, a 12.7-cm ﬁeld of view, and a 512 3 512
matrix. The calcium score was quantitated using a modiﬁca-
tion of the vendor supplied scoring software and a calcium
threshold of 130 Hounsﬁeld units (HU). Bone volume was
determined by summation of the cross-sectional areas of
each axial image multiplied by the 1.5-mm collimation
thickness. BMD was assessed as the average HU value for
each bone, and a measure of BMC was obtained by multiply-
ing the average HU value by the bone volume. This method
was demonstrated to have a highly signiﬁcant correlation of
the BMC determination with ash weight (r2 5 0.909), and a
between-run coefﬁcient of variation of 1.19%.

Torsion testing. The proximal and distal mouse femora
were potted into square molds using polymethylmethacrylate
cement. Torsional testing was subsequently performed using
a Burstein-Frankel torsion tester (8, 33). A deadweight pen-
dulum was used to reach torsional failure in less than 0.1 s.
The femora were tested in a random sequence and always in
external rotation. A torque/rotation curve was recorded using
a storage oscilloscope, and the results were photographed.
The curve was analyzed using a computer program written in
BASIC to measure the failure torque (N-m), angular defor-
mation at failure (rad), stiffness (N-m/rad), and toughness
(N-m z rad). These values were calculated using a linear re-
gression model over the linear aspect of the curve. Reproduc-
ibility of the technique determined by testing of left and right
femurs from 10 mice was 90%. Bones were excluded from the
analysis if they did not demonstrate a clean spiral fracture
indicating pure torque failure, or the angular displacement

was excessively large with low torque indicating slippage.
Satisfactory response curves were obtained on 117 of 140
attempted. Unsatisfactory test results were most commonly
due to slippage of the ends in the potting material.

Plasma biochemical measurements and aortic fatty lesion
quantitation. Plasma total cholesterol, high-density and low-
density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides,
and free fatty acids were measured as previously described
(32). Plasma leptin and insulin were measured by immuno-
assay according to manufacturers instructions, using kits
speciﬁc for mouse proteins (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN;
and Crystal Chem, Chicago, IL; respectively). Quantitation of
aortic fatty lesion formation was performed as previously
described. This entails histomorphometric analyses of Oil
red-O stained serial frozen sections of the ascending aorta
from the aortic valves through the aortic arch (42).

Linkage and data analyses. A complete linkage map for all
chromosomes except the Y chromosome was constructed at
an average density of 13 cM using microsatellite markers as
previously described (17). The constructed linkage map with
all markers used is available on request. PCR primers for
microsatellite markers were purchased from Research Ge-
netics (Huntsville, AL); methods for use were as described.
ANOVA, correlation, regression analyses, and hierarchical
clustering were performed using StatView version 5.0 (SAS
Institute, Berkeley, CA) and SPLUS 2000 (MathSoft). Link-
age maps were constructed and QTL analysis was performed
using MapMaker QTL (29) and QTL Cartographer (4). “Log
of the odds ratio” (LOD) scores were calculated at 1-cM
intervals throughout the genome for each of the traits under
consideration. Before analysis, the normal distribution as-
sumption underlying parametric tests for linkage was as-
sessed for each trait by examining the histogram, as well
as the skewness and kurtosis statistics for the trait values. In
addition, despite its low power, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
was applied to assist in determining whether a given trait
was sampled from a normal distribution. Traits demonstrat-
ing obvious departures from normality were log-transformed
or square root-transformed and then reassessed for normal-
ity. Linkage results for traits in which normality was ques-
tionable were veriﬁed using nonparametric association tests,
such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test, in determining marker/
trait associations. Trait values falling outside the mean 6 3
SD were considered outliers and excluded from analysis,
accounting for the variation in numbers given in Table 1. A
LOD score of 2.8 was the threshold for suggestive evidence of
linkage, and a LOD score greater than 4.3 was interpreted as
signiﬁcant evidence for linkage, as proposed by Lander and
Kruglyak for an F2 intercross with 2 degrees of freedom (25).
Composite interval mapping and multiple trait analysis. In
addition to the standard interval mapping techniques em-
ployed to detect loci affecting the traits of interest, additional
analyses were performed to determine whether controlling
for genetic background variation using markers outside a
putative region of linkage and whether multiple traits con-
sidered simultaneously could increase evidence for linkage.
Composite interval mapping (CIM) enhances the ability to
detect linked QTL over standard interval mapping methods
by incorporating markers as cofactors into the statistical
model for marker-trait association (30). Explicitly including
these cofactors into the model serves to control for genetic
background effects that would otherwise be confounded with
the experimental error terms, which, in turn, reduce the
chances of detecting linked QTL. All CIM analysis was per-
formed using QTL Cartographer (4). Given multiple quan-
titative traits, CIM analysis can be extended to consider
multiple traits simultaneously, potentially dramatically in-

tion. The phenotypes measured, with the mean and
standard deviations for each, are listed in Table 1. As
would be expected with complex quantitative traits,
these showed a wide range of values that were nor-
mally distributed in most cases. Hierarchical cluster-
ing analysis was performed to assess the overall rela-
tionships among the traits (Fig. 1). All pairwise
correlations were computed between the quantitative
traits, and then a standard agglomerative hierarchical
clustering algorithm was applied to the resulting cor-
relation matrix (21). All of the bone mass and density
traits, including cortical thickness, formed a common
cluster, suggesting it was reasonable to consider that
there may be common biologic and genetic determi-
nants among these. As a group, these were most closely
related to another cluster composed of body weight and

adipose tissue measures, including leptin. Bone biome-
chanical measures clustered most closely with several
metabolic traits, including plasma lipids and aortic
lesions.

In these F2 mice fed an atherogenic diet, there were
signiﬁcant interrelationships among traits potentially
associated with bone mass and density (Table 2). Ad-
ministration of an atherogenic diet to susceptible mice
induces a prooxidant state, manifested by aortic fatty
lesion development, and hyperlipidemia with in-
creased LDL but reduced HDL (37, 42). Aortic fatty
lesions were observed in over 90% of F2 animals and
were inversely correlated with plasma HDL/LDL ra-
tios. In mice, adipose tissue mass is positively corre-
lated with plasma HDL, and this was observed here
also (32, 36). Consistent with this was an inverse

correlation of adipose tissue (measured as total fat pad
mass, adiposity, or plasma leptin levels) with aortic
fatty lesions. Adipose tissue also inﬂuences plasma
insulin levels, and positive correlations were found
among insulin levels, plasma lipids, and adipose tissue
measures. Body weight is inﬂuenced by body size and
adipose tissue mass, and the expected correlations
among these were observed in these animals.

All of these were correlated with CT-measured BMD
and with additional bone-related parameters. Body
weight, body length, and adipose tissue measurements
all showed signiﬁcant correlations with measures of
bone mass, density, and biomechanics. Measures of
adipose tissue showed the strongest correlations
whether expressed as total fat pad mass or as adiposity
(range of r values 0.306–0.584). An independent con-
ﬁrmation of this association was obtained by measur-
ing plasma leptin levels, which had a similar pattern of
effect. Body weight showed signiﬁcant correlations
with many of these same measures, though the corre-
lation coefﬁcients were lower (r value range 0.144–
0.354). Body length showed the strongest correlations
with measures of BMC and BMD for the entire femur
(r 5 0.410 and 0.353, respectively). It was also signif-
icantly correlated with fracture strength and stiffness.
Stepwise regression analysis conﬁrmed the indepen-
dent inﬂuence of adipose tissue, leaving adiposity as
the only variable in the model for radiographic density
or cortical thickness. For total mineral content by CT,
stepwise regression identiﬁed both adiposity and body
length as independent contributors.

Analysis of plasma lipid correlations with bone mea-
sures showed that a prooxidant lipid proﬁle was asso-
ciated with reduced bone mass and density. HDL levels
were positively correlated with bone measurements,
whereas LDL levels were inversely correlated. Ex-
pressing these as a ratio of HDL to LDL increased the
correlation coefﬁcients, which were signiﬁcant for al-

most all the bone measurements (r values for bone
density measurements ranged from 0.202–0.315). Aor-
tic fatty lesions showed signiﬁcant inverse correlations
with bone mass and density. As plasma lipid levels are
themselves correlated with body adiposity and mor-
phometry, stepwise regression analyses were per-
formed to determine whether these were independent
factors inﬂuencing bone or were secondary. Results
showed that among the body morphometric and lipid-
and lesion-related parameters discussed, adiposity was
the major determinant for all, with body length being
the only other contributing independent variable for
the bone mass parameters. These measured variables
together accounted for ;25% of the observed variabil-
ity in the various bone mass and density parameters.
Identiﬁcation of genetic loci controlling bone-related
traits. A complete linkage map for all the chromosomes
except the Y chromosome was constructed using mi-
crosatellite markers, with an average interval of 13
cM. CIM was performed as implemented by QTL Car-
tographer software, using four background markers
identiﬁed by forward/backward regression analysis, in
addition to two ﬂanking markers for each trait and
locus. This analysis identiﬁed six loci showing linkage
with multiple bone-related traits (Table 3). These six
loci were further analyzed using the multi-trait pro-
gram (JZMAPQTL) of QTL Cartographer, incorporat-
ing up to four bone-related traits showing linkage to
the respective loci. At each locus, the LOD score ob-
tained by the multi-trait analysis signiﬁcantly ex-
ceeded that obtained by CIM for any one trait and were
highly signiﬁcant (LOD .5) for all six loci (Table 3;
Fig. 2).

Because each of the traits in this analysis had sig-
niﬁcant associations with QTL on other chromosomes,
ANOVA methods, including all cross-terms for two-
way and three-way interactions, were applied to deter-
mine whether there were signiﬁcant epistatic effects

GENETIC LOCI FOR BONE DENSITY IN MICE

mosomes with quantitative trait loci
(QTL) for bone-related traits, obtained
by CIM at 1-cM intervals as described
in the text. For each chromosome, the

along with the single trait CIM for the

In all cases, the joint analysis LOD

between QTL identiﬁed for each trait. The ANOVA
model for radiographic BMD yielded a signiﬁcant in-
teraction term between the QTL near markers
D6Mit198 and D15Mit13 (P 5 0.04). No other signiﬁ-
cant interactions were detected (including all higher-
order interactions). The nature of the epistatic inter-
actions could not be precisely determined from ANOVA
results, as multiple interaction terms appeared to con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the result.

In addition to considering multiple traits simulta-
neously and detecting epistatic effects, it is of interest
to determine the additive and dominance effects for a
given QTL. The CIM model and joint CIM models
provided in the QTL Cartographer software automati-
cally generate test statistics for assessing additive and
dominance effects. Table 3 summarizes the additive
and dominance effects for each of the six loci.

Colocalization of QTL for bone and nonbone traits:
potential pleiotropy vs. close linkage. QTL analyses
were also performed for the morphometric and meta-
bolic parameters that showed phenotypic correlations
with the bone-related traits. One or more QTL each
were identiﬁed for adipose tissue traits, leptin, body
weight and length, plasma lipids, and aortic lesions.

Three of the six QTL for bone-related traits were found
to be adjacent to or overlapping with QTL for nonbone
traits (chromosome 2, adipose tissue and plasma HDL;
chromosome 3, plasma LDL and body length; chromo-
some 6, adipose tissue and plasma HDL) (Figs. 3–5).
Among bone and nonbone traits with adjacent or colo-
calizing QTL, allele effects were similar in each case.
The colocalization of QTLs and concordant allele
effects among traits that had signiﬁcant phenotypic
correlation suggested the possibility that pleiotropy of
a common underlying gene rather than close linkage of
separate genes may be responsible. Data were evalu-
ated using a two-step process. First, in cases where
bone and nonbone traits gave rise to adjacent or colo-
calizing QTL, multi-trait CIM methods were employed
to determine whether the signiﬁcance of the linkages
could be increased by considering bone and nonbone
traits simultaneously. Second, if the multi-trait analy-
sis resulted in detecting a signiﬁcant effect, then the
likelihood of potential pleiotropy vs. close linkage was
tested to determine whether the signiﬁcant effect was
potentially due to a single QTL having pleiotropic
effects across all traits considered simultaneously or to
closely linked QTL. This was tested directly by appli-

cation of the statistical test developed by Jiang and
Zeng (18). As set forth by Jiang and Zeng (18), to test
the hypotheses of pleiotropy vs. close linkage for two
coincident QTL of interest, the multi-trait CIM likeli-
hood function must be reformulated. The hypotheses of
interest (H0 and H1) involve the position p1 of the QTL
having an effect on trait 1 and position p2 of the QTL
having an effect on trait 2 and are given by

H0: p1 5 p2
H1: p1 (cid:222) p2

The alternative hypothesis indicates that the QTL are
nonpleiotropic and are located at different map posi-
tions. The likelihood for H0 is the same as that given
for the multi-trait CIM model. However, the likelihood
for the alternative is that developed by Jiang and Zeng
(18). Using the prescription set forth by Jiang and
Zeng, calculation of the maximum likelihoods for each
hypothesis was carried out using the expectation-con-
ditional maximization (ECM) algorithm. Once the
maximum likelihoods under each hypothesis were
computed, the log ratio of the likelihoods was computed
to serve as the test statistic. This log-likelihood ratio
test statistic is asymptotic to a x2 distribution with 1
degree of freedom. The C11 software for testing these
particular hypotheses is available upon request.

Multi-trait analysis was performed on bone and non-
bone traits for QTL reported on chromosomes 2, 3, and
6. Incorporation of the non-bone-related trait(s) led to
signiﬁcant increases in the LOD scores for the loci on
chromosomes 2, 3, and 6 (Figs. 3–5). The pleiotropy vs.
close linkage test was then applied to each of the
speciﬁc genome regions deﬁned by the QTL resulting

from the multi-trait analyses. This test yielded the
following results. For chromosome 2, BMD-R and
BMD-Rd were tested against adipose mass and HDL
cholesterol to determine whether the QTL on chromo-
some 2 potentially represented the same locus (pleiot-
ropy) or distinct, closely linked loci. The pleiotropy test
could not be rejected at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level for
any of the comparisons. For chromosome 3, the chro-
mosome 3 QTL for BMC-CT was tested against the
adjacent chromosome 3 QTL for body length and HDL
cholesterol, to determine whether they potentially rep-
resented the same QTL or closely linked loci. The test
was rejected at the P , 0.05 level, for each comparison,
indicating that these loci were distinct. Finally, on
chromosome 6, total radiographic intertrochanteric
density (BMC-Rit) (at position 68 cM) was compared
with plasma HDL (at position 73 cM) and subcutane-
ous fat pad mass (at position 65 cM), and the pleiotropy
test could not be rejected at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.
It is of note that the pleiotropy test could be rejected at
the 0.01 signiﬁcance level when adipose tissue mass
(at position 50 cM) was compared against BMC-Rit (at
position 68 cM), indicating there may be two QTL
controlling for adipose tissue mass and subcutaneous
fat pad mass on chromosome 6.

The speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the pleiotropy/close
linkage test have not been thoroughly explored. How-
ever, the position of the QTLs tested affects the power
of this test, since the test is dependent on observing
recombination in the testing regions deﬁned by the
positions under consideration. Therefore, although in-
sufﬁcient support to reject this test is consistent with
pleiotropy, it does not prove conclusively that pleiotro-

pic effects of a single gene are controlling for the
multiple traits, since the power to detect multiple
QTLs at close distances is greatly reduced and since
these small distances may contain a large number of
genes.

DISCUSSION

This study has examined genetic and metabolic de-
terminants of bone mass and density in a set of genet-
ically heterogeneous older female mice with diet-in-
duced atherosclerosis. In these mice,
there were
signiﬁcant phenotypic correlations between bone pa-
rameters and those related to body morphometry and
adiposity, lipid metabolism, and atherosclerosis. By
the concomitant use of QTL and other genetic analyses
for these multiple traits, we sought to determine
whether there might be a genetic basis for these rela-
tionships. Six distinct loci were identiﬁed with signiﬁ-
cant linkage for multiple bone-related parameters, and
three of these coincided closely with loci showing link-
age to nonbone traits. Colocalization of QTLs may
simply represent close linkage of two or more genes
independently inﬂuencing the traits, as there are likely
hundreds of genes encompassed in the span of each
QTL at the current resolution. However, it may also be
indicative of the presence of common genetic determi-
nants (genetic pleiotropy), a possibility strengthened
by the presence of strong phenotypic correlations, con-
sistent allele effects, and known biologic relationships
between the colocalizing traits. We therefore developed
and applied novel statistical tools to improve the abil-
ity to distinguish closely mapped but independent loci
from those that are potentially pleiotropic.

Adipose tissue and plasma HDL traits were corre-
lated with bone mass and density as well as biome-
chanical properties, and loci on distal chromosome 2
and distal chromosome 6 showed colocalization of
QTLs for bone traits with both of these. For the chro-
mosome 2 and 6 QTLs, incorporating adipose tissue
and plasma HDL traits into the multi-trait QTL anal-
yses signiﬁcantly raised the strength of linkage, which
is consistent with pleiotropy. Additionally, the test for
pleiotropy vs. close linkage supported potential pleiot-
ropy for the chromosome 2 and the distal chromosome
6 loci. The chromosome 2 locus falls within a region
identiﬁed in other studies as showing linkage with
obesity (32).

Clinical studies have suggested that obesity confers
a protective effect against osteoporosis and fractures
that is independent of its contribution to body weight
(43, 44, 46). Traditional explanations for this include
the increased peripheral conversion of estrogen and
increased insulin levels associated with adipose tissue,
each having positive effects on bone mass and density
(11, 45). However, recent studies of the role of leptin
have shown that the situation is likely much more
complicated. Clinical studies have demonstrated that
plasma leptin levels are correlated with bone density
(31), as we observed in this study, and in vitro leptin
stimulates osteoblastic differentiation in progenitor
stromal cells (52). It is intriguing that adipocytes and
osteoblasts can be derived from common marrow stro-
mal precursor cells and thus might share common cell
biologic features (41). On the other hand, leptin is now
well documented to be a central neuroendocrine medi-
ator causing inhibition of bone formation, among other

effects (13). Also, administration of a high-fat diet to
mice can impair both central and peripheral sensitivity
to leptin (28) and cause reduced bone density (40).

Similarly, there is observational and experimental
evidence linking plasma lipids with bone density. Ath-
erosclerotic lesions and the concomitant lower plasma
HDL and higher plasma LDL cholesterol concentra-
tions were associated with reduced bone density, a
relationship observed in clinical studies in women (3,
19, 54). Although the relationship could simply be
parallel changes occurring with age, recent in vitro and
in vivo studies showing inhibitory effects of oxidized
lipids on osteoblast differentiation and on bone density
have provided evidence for a causative relationship
between these (38–40). Our ﬁndings of two loci show-
ing linkage with bone, adipose tissue, and plasma lipid
traits are intriguing in light of the above and allow us
to hypothesize that genetic pleiotropy may be respon-
sible. Further studies will be needed to deﬁnitively
establish whether this is the case or simply close link-
age of distinct genes is responsible for the observation.
Several recent studies have reported results of
QTL analyses for peak bone density in mice, includ-
ing one by Klein and colleagues (23) that utilized
recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the
same parental strains studied here. Before discuss-

ing our ﬁndings in relation to these, it should ﬁrst be
noted that the bone density traits examined here are
not directly comparable. Rather than reﬂecting peak
bone density, they purposely reﬂect bone density in
the more complicated setting of older age and the
concurrent administration of a highly atherogenic
diet. Both of these factors could be responsible for
some or all of the QTL identiﬁed. However, since the
traits reﬂect the cumulative genetic effects over the
life of the mice, the QTL may also reﬂect those
affecting peak bone density. In light of the latter, it
is of interest that the distal chromosome 2 locus was
linked with bone density in both our study and that
of Klein et al. (23), suggesting that it is indeed an
important locus. Although the same genetic varia-
tions should be present in the RI strains and in the
F2 intercross mice (since the parental strains are
similar), other loci were not found in common, which
may be explained by differing study conditions as
discussed above and, potentially, the different tech-
niques for measuring bone density. Also, in general,
studies with RI strains also have less statistical
power than those using intercrosses and are more
susceptible to false-positive results. Loci for peak
bone density in an intercross between strains C3H/
HeJ and C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J and CAST/Ei, and in

the osteoporotic SAM-P6 mouse have also been re-
ported recently and do not correspond to loci ob-
served in our study (5, 7, 51). In these cases, strain
differences would be expected to yield different loci,
in addition to the age and diet effects.

In humans, variations in the genotype for the vita-
min D receptor, estrogen receptor, collagen type 1a,
and interleukin 6 have been associated with differ-
ences in bone density, as has a QTL on chromosome 11,
but these are not mapped to any of the loci identiﬁed in
this study (15, 20, 24, 34, 53). It is important to note
that, in studies such as this, lack of linkage is simply
noninformative, as there may be no biologically rele-
vant genetic variation between the two strains used.
Also, as noted above, the QTL we have detected may be
related to age or diet effects rather than peak bone
mass. The next steps in the identiﬁcation of the genes
responsible at each of the loci identiﬁed here will re-
quire ﬁner mapping through the use of strains con-
genic for each of the loci. Continued identiﬁcation and
mapping of new genes through the various genome
projects will also expand the pool of candidate genes to
consider.

This study demonstrates the value of combining phe-
notypic and genetic analysis for elucidating the patho-
genic interactions among multiple related traits. Over
the past 5 years, a variety of statistical techniques
have been developed to resolve coincident QTL, to
consider multiple traits simultaneously, and to test
whether coincident QTL are closely linked or represent
pleiotropic effects from a single QTL. As the number of
traits being simultaneously analyzed increases, the
power to detect marker/trait associations can poten-
tially dramatically increase if appropriate statistical
models are used. The results obtained in this study
demonstrate this dramatic increase in power, and the
pleiotropy test developed by Jiang and Zeng (18) fur-
ther demonstrates that an application of more sophis-
ticated statistical tests can go far in elucidating the
underlying genetic factors contributing to multiple
quantitative traits. We were able to increase the evi-
dence for linkage, given by the LOD score, for six QTL
by more than one order of magnitude, on average, and
by more than three orders of magnitude in two cases.
In addition, we were able to reject the pleiotropy hy-
pothesis for the chromosome 3 loci, but were unable to
reject this hypothesis for the chromosome 2 and the
distal chromosome 6 QTL, by implementing and then
applying the pleiotropy vs. close linkage statistical
test. As more phenotype data obtain from a variety of
sources (including microarray-measured transcript
levels in addition to the more classic traits measured
here) there will be increased demand for more sophis-
ticated statistical methods capable of deriving more
information from the data, such as those we have
employed here. In our own study, we have tried to
maximize the available information in our data by
making use of the most advanced statistical techniques
available to date.
